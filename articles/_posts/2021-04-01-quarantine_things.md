title: "My Quarantine Things"
---

Sung in the tune of “My Favourite Things” from *The Sound of Music*.

Going for days without getting some sunlight,\
Staring for hours at screens that are too bright,\
Missing the days we could have band and strings,\
These are a few of my quarantine things

“Do we sign in today?” I can’t stop asking,\
At least I can’t forget which class I’m having (I still do),\
Bad wifi during my google meetings,\
These are a few of my quarantine things

Saying I’ll try new things in the beginning,\
One whole year later and I’m still not baking,\
I hope this pandemic has an ending,\
These are a few of my quarantine things

Changing out of\
Pyjamas is\
Basically self care\
It pains me to say this but some still need help\
Remembering to\
Stay home :)
