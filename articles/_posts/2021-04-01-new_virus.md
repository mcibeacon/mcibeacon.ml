title: "ü•ì BREAKING NEWS: NEW VIRUS HAS BEEN DISCOVERED AND HAS INFECTED OVER 1,000,000 PEOPLE"
---

The Coronavirus is rapidly spreading, with over 126 million cases and
2.76 million deaths. But that is not the virus we should be concerned
about.

Four days ago, students at the University of Toronto found an unknown
strain of virus in a young man‚Äôs bloodstream. He had been going on about
the anime *The Promised Neverland* nonstop. He also had an extremely
high fever, a sore throat, severe pain in his chest and a splitting
headache. Two days later, he fell into a coma, after his sister had told
him that his waifu was not real and passed away twelve hours later.

Ever since then, Canadian citizens started showing similar symptoms as
the deceased man. From the research, medical scientists have gathered
that this virus is caused by watching anime, reading manga and/or light
novels, as well as playing anime styled video games. As a result,
victims will gain a sudden obsession of Japanese pop culture. Due to
this, researchers have decided to call this strain of virus ‚ÄúAnimeitis‚Äù.

‚ÄúMy daughter has always found anime ‚Äúgeeky‚Äù and ‚Äúchildish‚Äù. Next thing I
know, she is hooked on the *Jojo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure* franchise*.* She
has been binge watching it nonstop,‚Äù a tearful mother reports.

There have also been reports of individuals believing that anime is real
or that they are in an anime. For instance, a woman in Vancouver has
been trying to awaken her ‚ÄúQuirk‚Äù to no avail. She has also started
cosplaying as characters from *My Hero Academia*.

This virus has already infected millions of people across Canada, as
well as a few hundred cases in the States. Many provinces are now in
lockdown, including Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia and
Alberta. President Joe Biden is considering putting the entire U.S. in
lockdown as well. Many world leaders have also put their countries in
lockdown, as they are afraid their own citizens suffer Animeitis as
well.

We still have little knowledge on Animeitis, but Ontario‚Äôs Ministry of
Health‚Äôs President, Iain Stewart, has told us which symptoms to watch
out for, as well as how to prevent the virus from spreading further.

‚ÄúThe usual symptoms of COVID-19; fatigue, fever, sore throat, diarrhea,
headaches, and difficulty breathing are present. A sudden obsession with
anime, and in worst cases, believing that it is nonfiction are the
symptoms that differentiate Animeitis from the superior virus.‚Äù Stewart
says. ‚ÄúAs for precautions to take, don‚Äôt go outside unless you
absolutely have to. If you do, wear a mask and avoid interacting with
people. Since the virus can spread at a wide range compared to the
coronavirus, stay at least twelve feet away from others instead of only
seven. Wash your hands frequently and sanitize. Avoid touching your
face, eyes, nose and mouth. And most importantly, do not come into
contact with anything anime based.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if your loved ones have been infected, do *not,* under any
circumstances, tell them that anime is not real. This will cause them to
either have a severe heart attack or stroke. All individuals who have
been told this harsh reality have died shortly after,‚Äù he reports
gravely. ‚ÄúInstead, have them self-isolate immediately. The recovery
process is the exact same as COVID-19. If we work together, we can
combat Animeitis.‚Äù

Animeitis is still being researched around the world and a vaccine is
yet to be developed. One major question being asked is if it is possible
for those infected with the virus to become sicker upon being further
exposed to Japanese entertainment, including anime, JMMORPGS, manga,
light novels and J-pop. But rest assured that once infected, cases will
not worsen. All we can do now is pray that we can put an end to this
before it gets out of hand.
