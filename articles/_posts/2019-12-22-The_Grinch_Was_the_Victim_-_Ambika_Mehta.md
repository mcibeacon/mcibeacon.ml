title: The Grinch Was the Victim
---

When the Grinch was just a baby

He was left rejected and dangling from a tree

While he watched the people of WHOville

Attend the annual Christmas party.

Resilient of the traumatizing events

The Grinch continued his life

Until he met Martha May

And hoped to one day, make her his wife.

Regardless of the Grinch

Being an outcast in society,

He decided to gather up his courage

And pursue Martha wholeheartedly.

Hoping that Martha would see past his rich

green skin and hair aplenty,

He had an idea that brought him nothing

But what felt like notoriety.

The poor Grinch stayed up all night creating

The perfect gift for Martha, a girl he adored,

But was made fun of by Augustus

MayWHO, who's irrelevant entity needed to

be ignored.

The Grinch cut his face when he tried

shaving his hair

And when he returned to school

He was surrounded by laughter everywhere.

"I hate Christmas, I HaTe It!" the Grinch would say,

But he failed to realize that the people of WHOville were phonies
anyway.

They made the Grinch feel unwanted and were materialistic fools

Their hearts were small and were straight up cruel.

He isolated himself from the people of

WHOville and went to live on top of Mount Crumpit

He was accompanied by his dog, Max

Who was always there for him, lickety split

The Grinch's heart went from big to small in

a matter of time

He grew older and became sour as lime

He had a plan to wreck Christmas for everyone in the town

But WHO could blame him, the Grinch was a genius, and deserved a crown.

There was one thing that needed to be served, and that was justice

Particularly from the snotty bully named Augustus.

Unfortunately, Augustus became the mayor of the small town,

But little did he know it was all going *doowwn*.

Fastforward, the mayor proposed to Martha in front of the Grinch,

But it wasn\'t until Martha said "My heart belongs to someone else",

that the Grinch's heart grew more than an inch.

In conclusion the people of WHOville suck

and the Grinch has nice lashes. The End.
