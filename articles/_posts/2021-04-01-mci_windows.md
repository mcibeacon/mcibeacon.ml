title: "ü•ì The Reason MCI Doesn‚Äôt Have Windows"
---

Hey Bears! Regardless of how long you‚Äôve been at MCI, you‚Äôve definitely
noticed that our school lacks a significant thing: windows. We, at the
Beacon, recently came across ancient MCI history books, and discovered
the reason why our school doesn‚Äôt have windows. We feel that it is our
journalistic duty to share this information with you, so behold, the
true story of why MCI does not have windows. Enjoy!

MCI was designed in the 1960s by a man known as the Great Baron of
Martingrove, E.N. Closure. His family was of great wealth and status
here in Etobicoke, yet the Baron was the last living member. It‚Äôs
important to mention that the Baron‚Äôs family had a bitter rivalry with
the other resident affluent family, the Fenetres. The two families had
been disagreeing for centuries, ever since their great grandfathers got
into an argument about the true solution of 1+1. Their dispute resulted
in a violent cheese bread fight, but then ended with a group of geese
chasing them both away.

The Baron wanted to build a school in his family‚Äôs name, to maintain
their legacy. He had many lavish plans for the school: great big
hallways, spacious lockers, adorned with beautiful school colours of
green and white, and most importantly, lots of glorious windows. The
Baron was just about to begin constructing this very school, when he
received the list of students who would be enrolling. All was in order,
until he saw one name at the very bottom of this list: Lisa Fenetre, the
youngest member of the rival Fenetre family. She would be attending
grade 9 at the Baron‚Äôs school. This sent the Baron into a fury, and due
to his blind rage towards the Fenetres, he completely scrapped all his
plans for the school. Most notably, he knew that the Fenetres loved
natural light and looking outside, so he decided not to put any windows
in any classrooms. They would only be in the stairwells and at the ends
of the hallways. He wanted Lisa‚Äôs school experience to be miserable, and
for her to spend countless hours in math class actually learning what
1+1 is, without distractions.

A few days later, Lisa Fenetre‚Äôs father, Charles, got word of the
Baron‚Äôs punishing plans for Lisa and the school. He was outraged, and
went to visit the Baron‚Äôs house on a street that was, at the time,
called Summerton. The two had a long fight; one so brutal and cold that
it caused a chill throughout the street. Finally, the Baron couldn‚Äôt
tolerate the verbal insults any longer. He went inside his house, and
emerged minutes later with handfuls of Jerry‚Äôs hotdogs, which he began
throwing at Mr. Fenetre.

‚ÄúGet out of here, get off my property! I'm going to build the most
enclosed school in all of Etobicoke!‚Äù shouted the Baron.

And because of the sheer power of Jerry‚Äôs hotdogs, Mr. Fenetre was
forced to concede, and return to his own home. The Baron, now unopposed,
was free to proceed with his plans. He built his school of regular
hallways, decorated with dull brown and orange school colors, and no
windows. As desired, he named the school Martingrove, after his own
family‚Äôs title.

That year, Lisa Fenetre attended Martingrove in the fall. She, along
with the rest of her family, was repulsed by the lack of windows within
the classrooms. Lisa transferred to Richview three months into the
school year. She went on to live a good life, but never did learn what
1+1 actually equalled. (do you know?!)

After the triumph of building his school, yet unable to truly punish the
Fenetres, the Baron sadly died at the age of 81. He died due to
excessive consumption of cheese bread, while surrounded by his
collection of computers that never connect to the school wifi. The
Martingrove legacy lives on through his school, and all those who attend
it.

On that note, we end the fascinating story of why MCI doesn‚Äôt have
windows. We hope you learned something valuable through this story, and
always remember the supremacy of Jerry‚Äôs hotdogs. Without them, our
school may not have existed!
