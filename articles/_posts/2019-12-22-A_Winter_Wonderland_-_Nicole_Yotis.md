Winter is my favourite season, without a doubt. The snow makes
everything look so picturesque and the break is right on our doorstep.
However, for some people, the holidays are dull, with no school to
occupy their days, and friends gone on vacations. But fear not, there
are still so many things to do.

1.  **Anything snow-related:** Take advantage of the season and get out
    there. Build a snowman, go sledding or skating, or have a snowball
    fight. Winter is also the time to ski, or try something more
    outlandish, like ice fishing or snow sculpting. One of my favourite
    things to do is build a snow fort with my friends. 
2.  **Indoor activities:** However fun it is to play in the snow, it's
    cold. But inside, you can make crafts (a great gift idea), catch up
    on your reading, draw (the snowy landscape will provide lots of
    inspiration), or learn to cook something new. Also, drink hot
    chocolate, especially after playing in the snow (that's the best
    time to drink it).
3.  **Go to a concert:** There are lots of concerts in December, many
    with holiday themes. So whether you'd like to go see your favourite
    artist, or maybe go somewhere new, there will definitely be
    something to peak your interest.
4.  **Catch up with old friends:** I have many friends from elementary
    school who I haven't seen in a long time. The break is a great time
    to reach out and plan a time to get together. And if you don't know
    what to do when you see them, perhaps you should try something from
    this list. Happy holidays!
