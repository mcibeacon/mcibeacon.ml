title: "ü•ì Taylor Swift To Quit Music Forever?"
---

Many feelings arose when this news developed: Taylor Swift, named ‚Äúthe
music industry‚Äù herself, is going to quit music forever. These were
largely feelings of shock, frustration, and confusion, followed by
experiencing all her albums again.

Noted, there was previously a similar scare in a candid interview with
*Rolling Stone*, where Taylor Swift revealed she almost quit making
music. However, this time, sources reveal that this news is real.


‚ÄúAfter the sudden and highly welcomed releases of *Folklore* and
*Evermore*, Taylor Swift is to stop making new music,‚Äù revealed a
trusted source. It is predicted that she will be focusing solely on her
re-recordings.

Although this unexpected announcement is saddening, one can find joy in
looking at the bright side of things. With re-recordings, we can return
to our childhoods, and additionally, hear lyrical masterpieces that were
originally in the ‚Äúvault‚Äù but have made a joyous escape engrossed in
parentheses. Additionally, hardcore Swifties are known to overthink, to
a point where they are counting the amount of spaces Taylor Swift has
put between her captions and if they have any relation to the number 13.
Surprisingly, there is nothing irrational about this practice, as
‚Äúeaster eggs‚Äù are hidden on a consistent and bordering maniacal basis
for this artist.

Yet, throughout all of this, disbelief is a feeling that will definitely
be shared. Largely because of the fact that TS13 is yet to be released.
As strange as this may seem to the common folk, it has valid reasoning
behind it. A person who plans for the release dates of her albums to add
up to ‚Äú13‚Äù cannot possibly not have thirteen albums in her discography.
So perhaps, this news is an easter egg within itself. Is someone going
to count the number of letters and the exact second to which this was
posted? However, for some reason, if it is in fact true, manifesting it
to be false is always an option.
