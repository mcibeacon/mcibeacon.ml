title: MCI Pandemic Perspectives
---

We posed a list of relevant questions to MCI students at each grade
level, once in May, then again in November. These students gave brief
responses, accounting for their unique experiences over the past few
months. The goal was to recognize the different perspectives among
people, even though they're all from one community. We wanted to show
how drastically different our lives are now than they were when the
pandemic first began. We hope you might be interested to know how others
at MCI were affected, and how it might differ from your experiences.

## What was your first impression/how did you feel when first hearing about the virus?

**Grade 9:** My first impression on hearing about the virus was that it
was important, but not as much of a global issue as it turned out to be.
It seemed to be somewhere in the middle between a simple flu and a big
virus; something we needed to take precautions to avoid, but not a major
issue. I never thought that it would reach pandemic level because it
wasn't made to seem that serious.

**Grade 10:** Initially, like most people, I wasn't too concerned. I
thought because the virus wasn't in Canada we didn't have much to worry
about. However, when we started to get cases over here I wasn't
distressed, but I was apprehensive to be in large groups or near people
who seemed to be sick.

**Grade 11:** When I first heard about the virus, I didn't think it would
become as big of a deal as it did. But as it got worse and worse I was
shocked at how it got out of hand so quickly. I was just praying that it
didn't hit Canada like it was hitting countries in Europe, like Italy
and China.

**Grade 12:** Personally, when I first heard about the virus months ago, I
didn't think it was too serious. It wasn\'t something I really worried
about until it got more severe.

### Follow Up: How do you currently feel about the pandemic situation?

**Grade 9:** I am not too bothered by the pandemic situation at the
moment. We are still doing school, which I prefer in quads, and the
major difference is that you can not go out and socialize. I miss that,
but I am still able to communicate with my friends on video games and
social media as well as at school.

**Grade 10:** The pandemic has been around for months now and it's hard
not to be a little tired of our current situation. I am still very
concerned with COVID and I am diligent in my safety measures, however
I'm finding it taxing mentally and I'm hopeful we will have this under
control soon.

**Grade 11:** It still upsets me quite a bit. But at this point as I'm in
grade 12, all I am really hoping is that I can start university without
any/a lot of restrictions. I really want to be able to go into school
and have frosh. I've gotten used to it as well, and in some ways
forgotten what life was like before the virus, which I guess is sad but
is also normal. I really loved summer because I was working and
constantly seeing people at work which was nice, and now it's nice
school is open. I just wish it was more than every other day or less if
you have a spare. In short, I feel better, but my feelings haven't
really changed. I find it hard to be optimistic on a day to day basis.

**Grade 12:** I think I have grown pretty used to being in a pandemic. I
wish it would end so I could stop doing uni online and not have to hear
the phrase "unprecedented times" ever again.

## How are you adjusting to life at home?

**Grade 9:** I actually like working on my schoolwork at home. It is
giving me more independence and time management skills, which I think
are valuable. Also, I like the fact that I am able to work on my own
agenda; if I finish something in 25 minutes, I am able to move on to
something else rather than do nothing until the period ends. This
actually reduces the time I spend on work and I am able to finish quite
early. I do miss socializing with my friends, but I am still finding
ways to communicate through social media and video games. It is tough at
times, but not unbearable, and I try to make the most of it.

**Grade 10:** Life at home is positive. It can be challenging, being stuck
with your family for too long can do that sometimes. So far I'm coping
with it fairly well.

**Grade 11:** Originally I had a hard time adjusting to not being able to
see people and especially my friends. But after the first few weeks I
settled into it. It's weird because the days feel short and I lose track
of time easier but I've gotten used to it in a way. I still don't like
it though to be honest.

**Grade 12:** For the most part, I'm enjoying my time in self-isolation,
sleeping in, and watching Netflix has become a regular part of my
schedule. I have been able to spend quality time with my family and
while I miss my friends a lot (shout out to the gang\<3), they're only
one call away. However, I have to say online school may be the worst
thing I have to go through in quarantine :(

### Follow Up: How is life at home currently?

**Grade 9:** I enjoy working at home because it allows me to work on my
own schedule. I get bored at times at home but I am always able to find
things to do so that is not a major issue.

**Grade 10:** Life at home is good, I'm always finding new things to do
and projects to finish. It's just hard always being in the same place. I
have gotten pretty sick of my bedroom after all of these weeks.

**Grade 11:** I've honestly been really enjoying living at home. Sometimes
it gets boring and repetitive, but I enjoy spending time with my family.
I've noticed that I've become more introverted in a lot of ways so I've
adapted to it more. I'm honestly turning into a homebody!

**Grade 12:** Life at home is good! As I hear about the prospect of
another lockdown, I feel pretty annoyed, but not really at the lockdown
itself. Instead, I am annoyed at people who acted like the pandemic was
over back in September and October, and took no time to consider how
their actions may affect others. I hope this lockdown will be short and
is effective in reminding people they have to be responsible.

## Give three words to describe the current pandemic situation.

**Grade 9:** People making adjustments

**Grade 10:** Chaotic, Mysterious, Daunting

**Grade 11:** Futuristic, Chaotic, Mayhem

**Grade 12:** Surreal, Hopeful, Lonely

### Follow Up: Give three words to describe the pandemic situation.

**Grade 9:** Work in progress

**Grade 10:** Strenuous, Complicated, Exhausting

**Grade 11:** Hazy chaotic mess

**Grade 12:** Wild, Isolating, Insightful

## What is one piece of advice you wish you could give to yourself before this all started happening?

**Grade 9:** I would probably tell myself to do more, and to be more
involved with things, because all this time is making me realize that I
am missing doing all of these things, and I could have been doing them.
An example would be volunteering. I easily could have volunteered more,
and now that I can't, I am regretting not doing it before.

**Grade 10:** Get bubble tea before it\'s too late. Also, don't leave your
math textbook in your locker over March Break because you can't get it
back now.

**Grade 11:** Don't stress as much and live in the moment. I know that
sounds cheesy but it's true. One thing that this has really taught me is
that time is so valuable and unexpected things always get in the way of
your plans.

**Grade 12:** I want my pre- epidemic grade 12 self to know that they
should have lived more in the moment when they had the chance, and not
have pushed experiences they really wanted to have to summer 2020
because they were too focused on university or job applications.

### Follow Up: Would you change the piece of advice you gave to yourself back in May, and if so, how?

**Grade 9:** No I wouldn't because I think that for the most part I have
used the advice and tried to take advantage of the virtual clubs and
opportunities so that I am more involved.

**Grade 10:** Yes I would change that advice. First of all you don't need
bubble tea, and your math textbook will be fine. Pick up a good book and
use this time to do something you love. Don't just waste these days,
they still count.

**Grade 11:** Not really. I agree with what I said. If I had known things
would change and this virus would last more than 3 weeks, I think I
would have changed the way I was living\-- less worried about what
others think because that wastes too much time.

**Grade 12:** I don\'t think I would change my advice, but I would add to
it. First, I would want to tell myself that even when I feel alone,
there will always be people around me who I can talk to. They were
probably feeling the same way I was. Second, I would also add something
about making a schedule for yourself, otherwise, you *will*
procrastinate. Finally, I would tell myself to stay positive and focus
on myself\<3

## What is the thing you miss the most about school, activities, and just going out in general?

**Grade 9:** I really miss just seeing people, and being in a different
setting. I can still communicate online, but it's still not the same as
talking to your friends in person, or carpooling with friends. That is
what I am missing most. I am also missing changing my setting. The fact
that I can't go to places and do things makes me realize how much I like
going to those places and doing those things. Mainly, I am referring to
soccer. I am a soccer player, and I really miss being out there with my
team, practicing, and playing. That will be the first thing I want to do
after the pandemic situation eases.

**Grade 10:** The thing I miss most about going out would probably be the
variety. There was always something different everyday, what I was
doing, who I saw, whether or not we had strings with Stoica that day.
Now I find myself waking up and doing the same thing everyday. It would
just be great to see some fresh faces and not resort to watching Glee
for 4 hours straight. I miss the variation the most.

**Grade 11:** My friends! I miss seeing them so much and video calling is
definitely not the same as seeing them in person.

**Grade 12:** The thing I miss the most about school is everyday human
interaction, which I often took for granted. I wish I made the most of
all the clubs and activities in that final week of school because I
didn't know they were going to be my last. Despite my final year being
cut short, the experiences I had and people I met at MCI have had a huge
impact on me and I will really miss being part of it.

### Follow Up: What's one thing you currently miss about "normal" life?

**Grade 9:** The one thing I miss most about is going out and socializing
with people face to face, and also being able to go into restaurants and
stores. I also miss being able to go out without a mask.

**Grade 10:** The biggest thing would be seeing my family and friends.
FaceTime and Zoom do not do justice to seeing people in real life.
Hopefully soon things will turn around and my interaction with them will
be more frequent.

**Grade 11:** I miss seeing my friends, and going to school to see people!
Like all the time! It makes me so sad that there are so many people I
may not get to see at all this year :(

**Grade 12:** One thing I miss about normal life which I took for granted
is getting to see my friends face-to-face almost every day. Now it's
always over Zoom, and if I do see them, it's only every once in a while.
