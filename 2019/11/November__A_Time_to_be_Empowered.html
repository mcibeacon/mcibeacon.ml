    "body": "2021/04/01 - MCI students have changed much of their school life to combat theCovid-19 virus. We have to wear masks, socially distance, and use thequadmester system, if we are going to school at all. However, we stillhave the luxury of using the amazing Martingrove washrooms, a luxurythat we may also have to give up. In a secret meeting with Beacon staff,the administration at our school revealed their plans to ban the use ofour bathrooms, mandating instead MCI Bear diapers for all students. We’ve decided to break the news to the public, as this is a great blowto our community. Of course, we must take all measures necessary to combat this pandemic. If that means wearing diapers, then so be it. We recognize that this maybe a change, but honestly, it is a return to a simpler time. Just 14years ago, most Martingrove students would have been walking around witha diaper anyway, so this might be just the change we need to be morecomfortable at school. This is not only for in person students though. Because Martingrove aimsto be inclusive and incorporate everyone into our community, the schoolhas decided that virtual students will also partake in this diaperwearing. This is to unite the students and have us all feel the bearspirit. All students can pick up their Bear Diaper at the main office onMonday and Tuesday. Remember, we’re all in this together!

    "title": "🥓 Taylor Swift To Quit Music Forever?",
    "body": "2021/04/01 - Many feelings arose when this news developed: Taylor Swift, named “themusic industry” herself, is going to quit music forever. These werelargely feelings of shock, frustration, and confusion, followed byexperiencing all her albums again. Noted, there was previously a similar scare in a candid interview withRolling Stone, where Taylor Swift revealed she almost quit makingmusic. However, this time, sources reveal that this news is real. “After the sudden and highly welcomed releases of Folklore andEvermore, Taylor Swift is to stop making new music,” revealed atrusted source. It is predicted that she will be focusing solely on herre-recordings. Although this unexpected announcement is saddening, one can find joy inlooking at the bright side of things. With re-recordings, we can returnto our childhoods, and additionally, hear lyrical masterpieces that wereoriginally in the “vault” but have made a joyous escape engrossed inparentheses. Additionally, hardcore Swifties are known to overthink, toa point where they are counting the amount of spaces Taylor Swift hasput between her captions and if they have any relation to the number 13. Surprisingly, there is nothing irrational about this practice, as“easter eggs” are hidden on a consistent and bordering maniacal basisfor this artist. Yet, throughout all of this, disbelief is a feeling that will definitelybe shared. Largely because of the fact that TS13 is yet to be released. As strange as this may seem to the common folk, it has valid reasoningbehind it. A person who plans for the release dates of her albums to addup to “13” cannot possibly not have thirteen albums in her discography. So perhaps, this news is an easter egg within itself. Is someone goingto count the number of letters and the exact second to which this wasposted? However, for some reason, if it is in fact true, manifesting itto be false is always an option.

    "title": "🥓 BREAKING NEWS: NEW VIRUS HAS BEEN DISCOVERED AND HAS INFECTED OVER 1,000,000 PEOPLE",
    "body": "2021/04/01 - The Coronavirus is rapidly spreading, with over 126 million cases and2. 76 million deaths. But that is not the virus we should be concernedabout. Four days ago, students at the University of Toronto found an unknownstrain of virus in a young man’s bloodstream. He had been going on aboutthe anime The Promised Neverland nonstop. He also had an extremelyhigh fever, a sore throat, severe pain in his chest and a splittingheadache. Two days later, he fell into a coma, after his sister had toldhim that his waifu was not real and passed away twelve hours later. Ever since then, Canadian citizens started showing similar symptoms asthe deceased man. From the research, medical scientists have gatheredthat this virus is caused by watching anime, reading manga and/or lightnovels, as well as playing anime styled video games. As a result,victims will gain a sudden obsession of Japanese pop culture. Due tothis, researchers have decided to call this strain of virus “Animeitis”. “My daughter has always found anime “geeky” and “childish”. Next thing Iknow, she is hooked on the Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure franchise. Shehas been binge watching it nonstop,” a tearful mother reports. There have also been reports of individuals believing that anime is realor that they are in an anime. For instance, a woman in Vancouver hasbeen trying to awaken her “Quirk” to no avail. She has also startedcosplaying as characters from My Hero Academia. This virus has already infected millions of people across Canada, aswell as a few hundred cases in the States. Many provinces are now inlockdown, including Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia andAlberta. President Joe Biden is considering putting the entire U. S. inlockdown as well. Many world leaders have also put their countries inlockdown, as they are afraid their own citizens suffer Animeitis aswell. We still have little knowledge on Animeitis, but Ontario’s Ministry ofHealth’s President, Iain Stewart, has told us which symptoms to watchout for, as well as how to prevent the virus from spreading further. “The usual symptoms of COVID-19; fatigue, fever, sore throat, diarrhea,headaches, and difficulty breathing are present. A sudden obsession withanime, and in worst cases, believing that it is nonfiction are thesymptoms that differentiate Animeitis from the superior virus. ” Stewartsays. “As for precautions to take, don’t go outside unless youabsolutely have to. If you do, wear a mask and avoid interacting withpeople. Since the virus can spread at a wide range compared to thecoronavirus, stay at least twelve feet away from others instead of onlyseven. Wash your hands frequently and sanitize. Avoid touching yourface, eyes, nose and mouth. And most importantly, do not come intocontact with anything anime based. ” “And if your loved ones have been infected, do not, under anycircumstances, tell them that anime is not real. This will cause them toeither have a severe heart attack or stroke. All individuals who havebeen told this harsh reality have died shortly after,” he reportsgravely. “Instead, have them self-isolate immediately. The recoveryprocess is the exact same as COVID-19. If we work together, we cancombat Animeitis. ” Animeitis is still being researched around the world and a vaccine isyet to be developed. One major question being asked is if it is possiblefor those infected with the virus to become sicker upon being furtherexposed to Japanese entertainment, including anime, JMMORPGS, manga,light novels and J-pop. But rest assured that once infected, cases willnot worsen. All we can do now is pray that we can put an end to thisbefore it gets out of hand.

    "body": "2021/04/01 - Meghan Markle has been a source of scandal in the British tabloids,upending many longstanding royal traditions. Among her alleged crimesare being multiracial, being a woman, being American, having parents,and existing. Yet her landmark Oprah interview in March led togroundbreaking journalists at Mail on Sunday discovering something farmore nefarious about the Duchess of Sussex - her breathing during theinterview. “We watched this video clip maybe a hundred times,” said bleary-eyedintern Leah Wimbleton. “We noticed that Markle displays a concerningneed for oxygen. See here, how she breathes between words? There’ssomething fishy going on. ” Self-described mature individual Piers Morgan was quick to offer hisinput on the shocking behaviour. “At the ten-minute mark, Meghanbreathes for nine seconds. The same number of letters in Voldemort’sname. Coincidence? I think not. It’s obvious, Meghan Markle is declaringher support for Death Eaters. ” QAnon fundraiser and self-proclaimed “clown entrepreneur” David Joneshad his own take on the story. “I’ve heard rumours that Darth Vader alsobreathes. I think there’s more connections between Markle and the Siththen the fake news media would lead you to believe. ” Markle’s breathing has also been linked to an avocado shortage in SouthAmerica, and higher infant mortality rates, according to Leslie Wilbur. “I saw it on Facebook,” she said. “Who does she think she is, taking theprecious breathing air that could go to children and babies? I don’tthink that climate change is real, or anything, but Meghan’s breathingsure does cause a lot of CO2 emissions. ” At press time, Meghan Markle’s breathing was also linked to COVID-19,the fall of the Roman Empire, and multiple Arkham Asylum breakouts inGotham.

    "body": "2021/04/01 - Last week, a series of tragic events occurred, starting with the mysterious eye of Eveloin Rib. But don’t worry - there’s mutton to fret about. “It all started in Science, last Monday morning,” said the Grade Ninestudent. “I was trying to pay attention, and then one of my eyes poppedout. ” Eveloin Rib’s eye gracefully leapt from its socket, witnessesrecalled, at 9:07 A. M. on Monday, rolling out the door and into thehallway. After pausing briefly to look out the window, it made its waythrough the Science hallway and tumbled down the stairs, although mysources do not specify when or how. The whole Science class spent themorning searching for the rogue eye, with no luck, but at last, Rib’seye was found cooling off in a water fountain. Like most of Eveloin’s classmates, Hamantha Mince was very relieved. “I’m just glad Eveloin’s eye was found. It would be unsettling knowingthat a stray eyeball still roams the halls of Meatingrove. “Wouldn’tthat be so unsettling?” said Mince in our interview yesterday. Eveloinis recovering in the hospital, and she will return to school by Monday. On behalf of all members here at The Bacon, I am extremely relieved forboth Eveloin and her reunited eye. As if a runaway eye wasn’t enough for our school last week, The Bacon’ssuper top-secret undisclosed headquarters were found ablaze on Tuesday,with no one at the scene. Although no one was there, sources state thata math test belonging to Grade Ten student Vee Ande was foundsuspiciously close to the cause of the fire: a can of Spam ignited bypyrokinetic powers. The Spam can appears to remain sealed and unchanged,so if anyone is looking for a meaty snack during breaktime, The Bacon’ssuper top-secret undisclosed headquarters are always open. Vee Ande was found the day after in the parking lot, pointing at similarcans of Spam and muttering to herself, “You meathead, it was just amisteak,” as she lit them on fire. I’m not pointing any fingers here,but I am. Thankfully, no one was injured, and the damage from the Spamfire was minute. It’s safe to say that we avoided being smoked bacon. In international news, the distant relative of Grade Twelve studentChuck Ram was knighted last week. Chuck’s recount of how he and SirAlexhamder Loin OBE are related was a convoluted mess to listen to, butI will take his word for it. Sir Loin entered knighthood on the 27th ofMarch at Buckingham Palace, being knighted Officer of the Most ExcellentOrder of the Brifish Empire by Queen Elizabeef II, for globalcontributions in the field of Physribs. Loin gave a very tender andheartwarming speech afterwards, followed by a lovely performance of “IWanna Hold Your Ham’’ by The Beefles. Last week was certainly filled with mayham, but we are just happyeveryone is safe and sound.

    "title": "🥓 The Reason MCI Doesn’t Have Windows",
    "body": "2021/04/01 - Hey Bears! Regardless of how long you’ve been at MCI, you’ve definitelynoticed that our school lacks a significant thing: windows. We, at theBeacon, recently came across ancient MCI history books, and discoveredthe reason why our school doesn’t have windows. We feel that it is ourjournalistic duty to share this information with you, so behold, thetrue story of why MCI does not have windows. Enjoy! MCI was designed in the 1960s by a man known as the Great Baron ofMartingrove, E. N. Closure. His family was of great wealth and statushere in Etobicoke, yet the Baron was the last living member. It’simportant to mention that the Baron’s family had a bitter rivalry withthe other resident affluent family, the Fenetres. The two families hadbeen disagreeing for centuries, ever since their great grandfathers gotinto an argument about the true solution of 1+1. Their dispute resultedin a violent cheese bread fight, but then ended with a group of geesechasing them both away. The Baron wanted to build a school in his family’s name, to maintaintheir legacy. He had many lavish plans for the school: great bighallways, spacious lockers, adorned with beautiful school colours ofgreen and white, and most importantly, lots of glorious windows. TheBaron was just about to begin constructing this very school, when hereceived the list of students who would be enrolling. All was in order,until he saw one name at the very bottom of this list: Lisa Fenetre, theyoungest member of the rival Fenetre family. She would be attendinggrade 9 at the Baron’s school. This sent the Baron into a fury, and dueto his blind rage towards the Fenetres, he completely scrapped all hisplans for the school. Most notably, he knew that the Fenetres lovednatural light and looking outside, so he decided not to put any windowsin any classrooms. They would only be in the stairwells and at the endsof the hallways. He wanted Lisa’s school experience to be miserable, andfor her to spend countless hours in math class actually learning what1+1 is, without distractions. A few days later, Lisa Fenetre’s father, Charles, got word of theBaron’s punishing plans for Lisa and the school. He was outraged, andwent to visit the Baron’s house on a street that was, at the time,called Summerton. The two had a long fight; one so brutal and cold thatit caused a chill throughout the street. Finally, the Baron couldn’ttolerate the verbal insults any longer. He went inside his house, andemerged minutes later with handfuls of Jerry’s hotdogs, which he beganthrowing at Mr. Fenetre. “Get out of here, get off my property! I’m going to build the mostenclosed school in all of Etobicoke!” shouted the Baron. And because of the sheer power of Jerry’s hotdogs, Mr. Fenetre wasforced to concede, and return to his own home. The Baron, now unopposed,was free to proceed with his plans. He built his school of regularhallways, decorated with dull brown and orange school colors, and nowindows. As desired, he named the school Martingrove, after his ownfamily’s title. That year, Lisa Fenetre attended Martingrove in the fall. She, alongwith the rest of her family, was repulsed by the lack of windows withinthe classrooms. Lisa transferred to Richview three months into theschool year. She went on to live a good life, but never did learn what1+1 actually equalled. (do you know?!) After the triumph of building his school, yet unable to truly punish theFenetres, the Baron sadly died at the age of 81. He died due toexcessive consumption of cheese bread, while surrounded by hiscollection of computers that never connect to the school wifi. TheMartingrove legacy lives on through his school, and all those who attendit. On that note, we end the fascinating story of why MCI doesn’t havewindows. We hope you learned something valuable through this story, andalways remember the supremacy of Jerry’s hotdogs. Without them, ourschool may not have existed!

    "title": "The Graviton: Future Fuel",
    "body": "2021/03/21 - Have you ever been filling the tank to your new spaceship and thought,“I wish there was a better way to power the engine. ” Enter the Graviton!With its subatomic superpower, its potential applications areunimaginable. To understand the graviton, we must first understand a bit of quantummechanics. The main principle is that everything is made of quanta – orpackets – of energy and these quanta behave as both particles and waves. Take visible light, for example, which is composed of packets ofelectromagnetic energy, or photons. There are four fundamental forces in the universe: gravity,electromagnetic force, weak and strong nuclear forces. All of these,except for gravity, have been proven to follow the laws of quantummechanics. This means they have specific subatomic “exchange particles”that interact with other particles to cause these forces. Electromagnetic force is caused by the photon. Strong nuclear force istraceable to the gluon. Weak nuclear force is transmitted by themovement of W and Z bosons. Knowing this, scientists predict that the elementary particle whichcauses apples to fall onto our heads and shooting stars to traverse thenight, is the graviton! If this mysterious particle exists, it isexpected to have no mass, no charge, and travel at the speed of light,similar to a photon. Though still considered theoretical, physicistslike Zvi Bern continuously challenge themselves to calculate thebehaviours of this particle with increasing precision, which involvestaking on new perspectives of the universe – even one where space-timeis an illusion. So if it fits with quantum mechanics and scientists can already predictits properties, why hasn’t the graviton been proven to exist yet? Forone, gravity is extremely weak, and as physicist Freeman Dyson oncestated, the detector needed to prove the graviton’s existence would haveto be so massive it would “collapse into a black hole. ” However, there is an even larger factor that has plagued the physicsworld for nearly a century: the struggle to unify Einstein’s Theory ofGeneral Relativity with quantum theory. Both have vastly different viewson gravity. While Einstein’s theory states gravity is an attractiveforce as the result of matter distorting space-time, quantum theoryviews gravity as being caused by the transferring of gravitons betweenparticles. Merging these two theories – and proving it – has been acomplex task for physicists, giving rise to fascinating hypotheses fromString Theory to pulling an Interstellar and falling into a black hole. It is only a matter of time until the existence of the graviton – or itsfuture equivalent – is proven. When it is, it will help us createnumerous mind-bending applications! The most intriguing being anentirely new way to fuel transportation. By harnessing a way tomanipulate the graviton, just as we manipulate the emission of photonsto create light, gravity can be used for future space travels. For example, we can facilitate more efficient spacecraft propulsion. Bymanipulating an area near a rocket to have a higher concentration ofgravitons, we can increase that area’s gravity, pulling the rockettowards this increased gravitational zone. This would work the same aswhen a spaceship loops around a planet to take advantage of itsgravitational field and increase its velocity. Now, instead of needingfuel to accelerate a spaceship, we can use gravity to our advantage. An even more ambitious application: creating our own wormhole to anotherpart of the universe! By greatly increasing the concentration ofgravitons in a certain area, we could succeed in curving space-time tocreate a shortcut to a different part of space – or even time. For now these are all just speculations. However, it is important toremember that scientific progress has evolved exponentially. Just over100 years ago, it was thought that neutrons and protons were thesmallest particles to exist. Yet, the discovery of quarks and even morefundamental particles have unveiled another layer in our quest todiscover the ultimate fabric of the universe. Although we may only be at the beginning of our journey of learning howthe universe works, that doesn’t keep us from searching further. We mustcontinue laying the foundations for our future discoveries, ceaselesslyreviving the world of science. "

    "title": "Capitol Hill Riots: Could It Happen Here?",
    "body": "2021/03/17 - On January 6, 2021, an armed insurrection occurred at the United StatesCapitol. This was the outcome of months of priming, where many electedofficials got their followers to believe things that would justify anattack on democracy. The question arises: could this happen in Canada?Let’s analyze the chain of events that led to the riots to figure itout. The uprising started with the delegitimizing of the mail-in ballots. Asearly as last April, former President Trump tweeted, “Republicans shouldfight very hard when it comes to state-wide mail-in voting. Democratsare clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and forwhatever reason, doesn’t work out well for Republicans…” By doing this,he initiated the idea that mail-in ballots are fraudulent, and shouldnot be counted. He continued to reiterate this up until the election. InCanada, this could definitely happen. Someone could suggest that therecould be mail-in fraud and that we should do everything possible to havea “free and fair” election. But would that be enough to start riots atParliament Hill? On November 7, 2020, when Joe Biden was declared the winner of thePresidential election, Trump and the majority of the Republican Partyclaimed that the entire election was rigged through mail-in ballots andvoter suppression in favour of Democrats. The idea of a stolen electionbrought America one step closer to the riots, because it wasn’t justimplying that there was a likelihood of fraud, but that the entireelection was rigged. Again, this could happen here in Canada. Theelection could be questioned. But would these two things be enough tocause a riot? Then, on January 6, there was a MAGA (Make America Great Again) rally inWashington D. C. . Trump’s speech was inflammatory; it was clear that heand the other speakers were pushing for what happened next. It startedwith the usual claims of election fraud. Then he proceeded to say that“History is going to be made. We’re going to see whether or not we havegreat and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders thatshould be ashamed of themselves throughout history. ” This is a clearcall to action. During the entire speech, there were lies in almostevery phrase such as, “This is the most corrupt election in the history,maybe of the world. ” The way he ended his speech was one of his mostovert incitements of insurrection. “So we’re going to, we’re going towalk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we’regoing to the Capitol and we’re going to try and give… The Democrats arehopeless…But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weakones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going totry and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to takeback our country. ” This messaging was being fed to a mob that alreadyfelt as though they had all been cheated. They managed to breach theCapitol, desecrate it, and try to attack congresspeople. Eventually itwas dealt with, and they were removed, but the ideological meaningbehind this shows the great divide in our society. The dogmatism of theMAGA movement is clear, and because Trump is their divine figure, theywill defend him at the cost of democracy. Refusing the results of anelection because your candidate lost is anti-democratic because itundermines the entire foundation of the system. January 6 was the climaxof election tensions and something this drastic most likely wouldn’thappen in Canada. There would only be a portion of the population thatwould believe in the possibility of fraud, and most Canadians probablywould not want to engage in violence. This is a drastic step thatCanadians wouldn’t take. However, claims of fraudulent ballots and the questioning of validity ofsome ridings are two valid possibilities. Regardless, this wouldn’t leadto an uprising as it did in the United States. In a recent poll by AngusReid, less than 1 in 5 Canadians believe that the U. S. election wasunfair. An even smaller number would attend a violent rally to protestthat. Even more proof of this is the Canadian federal government’sdecision, on February 3, to declare the Proud Boys as a terroristentity. The Proud Boys are a far-right, neo-fascist group that regularlyengages in, and provokes, political violence. This decision was onlypossible because our politics are, in general, more left-leaning. Further Reading: Post-Riot Events After the insurrection, Trump was permanently banned from his socialmedia platforms, because the respective companies didn’t want to beassociated with him. His Twitter account had peddled blatantmisinformation in regards to election fraud and far-right conspiracytheories. After Trump’s social media removal, there was also a purge ofmany other far-right accounts across social media platforms, so theycould distance themselves from the January 6 attack. This wouldn’thappen here; our political climate would have to change drastically forone of our politicians to engage in activity that could get them bannedfrom social media. Trump then decided to not attend President Biden’s inauguration. He wasthe first outgoing President to not attend his successor’s inaugurationsince Andrew Johnson in 1869. This shows the intense divisivenesssurrounding the election, and the extreme lack of unity. If Trump hadaccepted his loss and been at the inauguration, it could have calmeddown some of the political tension in America. The inauguration itselfhad much more security than usual to prevent any violence like theinsurrection at the Capitol, and nothing happened. This was the finalmoment of the transfer of power, and the end of claims of ‘Trump canstill win’. This is something that Canadians would never do. Out ofpoliteness alone, they would attend their opponent’s swearing-inceremony. This timeline shows how a claim as simple as questioning the validity ofmail-in ballots can spiral into an insurrection at the centre of acountry’s democracy. Even though we might not get to that final stepanytime soon, we still have to remain wary of these problems becausethey aren’t unique to America. Canadians are not immune to the samerhetoric that is used in the United States. Many of the incrementalthings that happened there could also happen here. A Léger poll inSeptember showed that only 16% of Canadians support Donald Trump. However, when you break this number down it is more revealing; 41% ofCanadians who are affiliated with the Conservative Party of Canadasupport Trump. Pro-Trump rallies took place in Toronto and Calgary onJanuary 6. This is an issue across all of North America. To combat this,we need to restore faith in science, and continue to persist inde-radicalizing people from the right, to prevent other attacks such asthe Capitol Hill riot, or other anti-democracy movements such as#stopthesteal. Another tactic is to make these movements politicallyirrelevant. 34% of Americans and 33% of Canadians didn’t vote in theirlatest federal elections. Appealing to this demographic and getting themto vote would help a great deal in stopping violence and ending theundermining of our democratic values. An attack on Parliament Hill isn’t going to happen anytime soon. Despitethat, many actions and ideas adjacent to the attack are definitelypossible. It is up to us to stop them. "

I am Love by Ruchi Tilva won 2nd place , and Nighttime Reminiscence by Orikto Ahmad won 3rd place. Thank you to everyone who participated! Flowers: One sunny morning in the month of May,A cheerful gardener was making her wayTo her town’s annual flower displayTo bring her girlfriend a gift. Her cart piled high with all kinds of flowers,(Beautiful blue ones that smelled of spring’s showersAnd striking red ones that bloomed many hours)Her step was steady and swift. On the side of the road she spotted a man,His face turned down, his head in his hand,Muttering something ‘bout the fates of the damned,An empty bottle beside him. The gardener reached a hand down into her cartAnd pulled out an orchid the shape of a heart. The man startled, raised his head with a startAnd beheld the flower before him. But already, the gardener was walking once more,And already, poor travellers she met by the score. And already, she reached in the cart mentioned beforeTo give each one a flower. And though the feelings of goodwill grew,As her flowers depleted, the gardener knewHer stock would run out, clear and true,‘Ere the end of the hour. And surely enough, the flowers ran outAnd the gardener was left not a single sproutTo bring to her girlfriend, who was still, no doubt,Waiting in the town square. Now heavy hearted, the gardener walked on,Wondering what her girlfriend would think of flowers gone. Then at long last, she finally came uponHer town, up ahead of her. The gardener walked in the village, then looked ‘round,To spy her girlfriend, whom she quickly foundOver by the fountain, sitting on the ground,Waving the gardener over. Taking a breath, the gardener walked t’ward her,Wondering how she’d ever explain where the flowers were. The next few moments felt like a blurBut finally, she told her. Her girlfriend laughed, and said with a smile,“I don’t care about gifts, so long as you spend a whileOf your time with me, after walking many miles,It is you whom I have missed. ”A smile broke out across the gardener’s faceAnd the rest of the day, they stayed in placeEnjoying the other’s company and good graceAnd neither ever thought to resist.

    "body": "2021/02/08 - The unease across North America was palpable on January 6th, 2021. Whether you were watching the news, listening to the radio while drivinghome, or getting updates on Twitter, everyone was in disbelief as angrysupporters of Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol. It seemedincredulous that a group of pro-Trump rioters could have the boldness towreak such havoc and succeed. But our shock on the 6th was not justified: history and literature haswarned us for centuries that discrimination-based tensions always riseto the surface, and that beliefs in supremacy often result in danger tothose that don’t fit the mould. We should’ve been expecting a situationlike this, due to the racist nature of the attackers (people thatsupport Trump so avidly are almost always racist. ) Racial tensions havebeen bubbling in the United States for decades, but they reached aboiling point this past summer with a resurgence of the Black LivesMatter movement. This wasn’t our only warning. Literary stories ofviolent injustice have time and time again mirrored what we’re facingnow. Look, for example, at Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale. The Handmaid’s Tale is undoubtedly a story of injustice. It followsOffred, a woman under the patriarchal dystopian rule of Gilead, who isenslaved to be a child bearer. This story defines gender injusticerather than racial, but follows the same pattern of today’s challenges,starting with an event that parallels the attack on the Capitol. In The Handmaid’s Tale, the emergence of The Republic of Gilead wasspurred by an effective coup d’etat by the leaders of Gilead, the Sonsof Jacob, during which they “shot the President and machine-gunned theCongress… the entire government, gone like that…” (Atwood 162). Soundfamiliar? It should. If Capitol security had not been so quick toevacuate members of the Senate, including Vice President Mike Pence andVice President-elect Kamala Harris, maybe we would have faced aHandmaid’s Tale-esque situation of assasination. After all, many ofthe rioters were carrying guns and homemade explosives. But an even moreprominent parallel between the Sons of Jacob and the Capitol attackersis their beliefs. The standout belief among Trump’s most resolute supporters is theirwhite supremacist ideology. The Capitol rioters are the same people whopraised Trump’s racist immigration laws and his numerous raciststatements during his presidency; denounced the Black Lives Mattermovement and countered it with the mocking statement “All Lives Matter”;and continued to not care when black people were murdered by the policetime and time again, but rather praised the officers who did so. I’mscared of these people; we all should be. These rioters’ opinions are reflected in the obvious ones of the Sons ofJacob. For these men, having rank above all women is a fulfillment oftheir belief in male supremacy. This is exactly the belief of Trump’sarmy of white supremacists, just in terms of race rather than gender. Just as the Sons of Jacob are living in their own personal utopia whilethe women below them are in a tortuous dystopia, these whitesupremacists believe that the world should be made to suit their beliefsdirectly. Regardless of the common good, they care only for their ownbenefit and fulfillment of their personal ideology. The desire for whitesupremacy is directly achieved by having a white supremacist in highoffice; the loss of the rioters’ grand wizard spurred their attack. Therefore, these two instances are equal; one is a belief in malesupremacy, the other in white supremacy - but they’re cut from the samecloth. The Trump-crazed attackers of the Capitol compare to the Sons of Jacobin many ways. But this concept of supremacy, whether of skin colour orgender, is the backbone of all their similarities. When stronglybelieved in by a group of people, supremacy can have incrediblydangerous results for those outside of their ideal. The Sons of Jacob’sbelief in male supremacy in The Handmaid’s Tale is devastating to allwomen, just as today’s white supremacists’ beliefs have also beendevastating. White supremacy has taken lives, and the attack on theCapitol is only one example of the danger it brings. Both events, thefictional and the real, show that no matter how beneficial something isfor the ideology of one group, it is always detrimental to others thatdon’t hold the same belief. Thus, the Capitol attack and the fictionalreign of the Sons of Jacob are reason enough to be apprehensive of allsupremacists, no matter what they stand for. Image source "

    "title": "Snowflakes and People: How Differences Make Us Special",
    "body": "2021/01/28 - Have you looked outside lately? With the new year now upon us, we arebeginning to see the classic staple of living in this northern country:snow. White, soft, beautiful, all-encompassing snow. We watch, as eachflake hits the ground, bringing us deeper into the winter season. But ifyou have ever paid close attention to the individual snowflakes as theyfall, you’ve observed that each snowflake is different. Like snowflakes,people are unique, each having differences that deserve to becelebrated. To understand why differences are in our nature, we can lookat how snowflakes come to be different. Get ready for a small science lesson! Snowflakes are different due tothe fact that they each consist of countless water molecules. TheWashington Post states that, by one estimate, a snowflake may have up toa quintillion molecules! The process starts on the Earth’s surface, aswater evaporates from large water bodies. In the wintertime, the coldair causes the water vapour to form into small liquid droplets, whichcondense onto nearby matter like pollen, forming tiny ice crystals. Thecrystals float through the air, and collide with water vapour molecules. As they collide, the water vapour goes directly from a gas to a solid,turning a previously miniscule ice crystal into a snowflake that willfall to the ground. When these flakes first come together, they interestingly look quitesimilar; they all have a hexagonal lattice shape, due to the wayhydrogen and oxygen bond to make water. Certain edges of the snowflakesare rough and jagged; these are the parts that attract more watermolecules in hopes of becoming more uniform. The jagged arms have littleamounts of water molecules added to them, causing them to grow intointricate snowflakes. Each snowflake keeps developing, for about 45minutes to an hour, gathering more crystals on top of one another toform visible patterns. This causes the possibilities of a snowflake’sstructural arrangement to be just about endless. This process isincredibly interesting, because if snowflakes simply stopped developingright after their formation, they would all be pretty much the same. Yet with fluctuating temperatures, weather conditions, and physics,snowflakes take on distinct shapes and sizes. For example, ice crystalswill only form between -2. 8 and 0 degrees Celsius. If this temperatureis lowered, the snowflakes will have thin, needle-like structures, oreven “fern-like arms. ’’ Humidity also affects the appearance of asnowflake, with lower humidity making them wider. Higher humiditydevelops their edges more, and also provides optimal conditions forpacking snow! When thinking about the amazing singularities of snow, I can’t help butthink about how humans differ from one another as well. Each person hastheir own unique thoughts, experiences, and memories. No two people havelived the same life, meaning every single human has differing complexviewpoints on a variety of topics. Just like the crystals on asnowflake, we have undergone our own unique transformations, and ourexperiences shape the people we become. It’s absolutely mind-blowing! This fact is not meant to make you feel trivialized, but to do theopposite. Although we may seem similar on the surface, every person isdistinctive. Each and every one of us provides value to the world aroundthem, just as each snowflake falls to form a beautiful winterwonderland. So, the next time you look outside and see snowflakes descending one byone, be reminded of each one’s singularity. Marvel at the beauty ofnature, and its ability to create billions of entities, each beingexceptional and irreplicable.

    "title": "The Good Place: The Kind of Show We Need Right Now",
    "body": "2021/01/21 - The Good Place is a Netflix series that ran from 2018 to 2020. Itspanned four seasons, and was far from your typical sitcom. Meet EleanorShellstrop, a self-centred, terrible human being who is accidentallysent to  The Good Place , or Heaven, and must therefore improveherself in order to stay there. Over the course of the series, shelearns ethics from a philosophy professor named Chidi, befriends wealthysocialite named Tahani, meets a member of the all-powerful race ofJanets, and a number of other crazy characters. What makes The Good Place different from almost all the other showstoday is its rejection of the sitcom status quo. While it does focus onthe wacky hijinks of the main characters, it is unique because it putscharacter development at its forefront, and constantly rewrites itspremise. The show doesn’t truly come into its own until the end of season 1 -which, without spoiling anything, completely changes what you thoughtyou knew about the characters. From there it takes off, leaning into theabsurdity of its premise (featuring a struggling demon actress as one ofits highlights). This sitcom is one of the few shows that has managed tokeep me consistently guessing and entertained, without losing sight ofits original premise. For a show about philosophy, The Good Place deals with a number ofmoral and ethical dilemmas. Should good deeds count if they are forselfish reasons? What do we owe each other? I had never heard ofutilitarianism or moral particularism before, but the show manages tomake the learning of philosophy integral to the plot - without boringits audience. It helps that Jason, the walking embodiment of everyFlorida man stereotype, is always there with a story about his dancecrew, or a crazy crime he committed - or sometimes even both, as was thecase when he framed a girl named Sheila for stealing boogie boards tostop the best pop-and-locker on his dance crew from moving away. The key reason that The Good Place has appealed to so many peopleduring these times is because it offers a positive view on humanity. Ourinnovation, resilience, and desire to improve ourselves are at thecenter of the show, as Eleanor (and the others around her) become betterpeople. There are more than a few offhand remarks and jabs at oursociety today - particularly with Brent in season 4, who - as theepitome of the  dudebro  stereotype - is clearly based on SupremeCourt Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and manages to come across worse thansome of the demons on the show. However, at the end of the day, the message of the show is a positiveone, as each of the characters overcomes their flaws and become the bestversion of themselves. While the show condemns the humans for their pastactions, it praises them for their ability to improve themselves,showing the positive effect they can have on the world around them. In atime when so many people have resorted to negativity and pessimism, itis the little bit of positivity you didn’t know that you were missing. Over the course of the four seasons, there is one line that I thinkstands out above all others and nicely represents the main theme of theshow: “What matters isn’t if people are good or bad; what matters is ifthey’re trying to be better today than they were yesterday. ” We shouldall aim to be the best versions of ourselves, even when it’s hard andthere is no obvious reward. The Good Place has done exemplary work inshowing humanity at its highest and lowest. It manages to be optimisticabout our future, even when it feels like there isn’t much to beoptimistic about. This is why The Good Place is the kind of show weneed right now. Photo Source: Better Days Ahead by Ian Taylor, from Unsplash. "

    "title": "America as a Global Leader",
    "body": "2021/01/21 - Additional Contributors from the MMUN Team: Diana Brebeanu, MarkoVehauc, and Rohan Kumar. In 1948, U. S. President Dwight Eisenhower was quoted saying, “[T]hereason we call it ‘free world’ is because each nation in it wants toremain independent under its own government and not under somedictatorial form of government. ” (D. Tierney, 2017) Yet to consider theUnited States the leader of this ‘free’ world would be a contradictionof the term itself. Time and time again, America has demonstrated a lackof respect for both the sovereignty of other nations and towards its owndemocracy, while often neglecting to lead in necessary situations. Thus,one is led to wonder if America can really be considered the leader ofthe free world. One of the better-known examples of American interference in foreignsovereignty began in November 1970, when Salvador Allende wasinaugurated as the President of Chile. The great significance of thisevent: Allende was decidedly socialist. Early in his presidency, he tooksteps to nationalize the country’s copper industry and redistributeincome downwards. Despite being elected to a fixed term and thereforehaving his own country’s consent to govern, Allende lacked theapparently crucial consent of the CIA. Thus, he died of a gunshot duringan American-backed coup in 1973. Allende’s role as a democraticallyelected socialist in a country located in America’s backyard was fragileto begin with. The American ambassador to Santiago celebrated this eventby telling Henry Kissinger, former US Secretary of State, that “we shalldo all within our power to condemn Chile and the Chileans to utmostdeprivation and poverty. ” (H. O’Shaughnessy, 2013) The United States succeeded in doing this for 15 years after Allende’sdeath. Summary executions, “unexplainable” disappearances, and politicalsuppression were all fixtures of Chilean president Augusto Pinochet’sviolent regime, which received both military and financial support fromthe American government. The hope that Chile was an isolated incident ofAmerican misjudgement would be misplaced. In Iran, Guatemala, Zaire, andBrazil, the United States has provided both military and monetary aidtowards removing democratically elected leaders in favour of brutalmilitary juntas or outright dictatorships. Naturally, this raises the question: What sort of country wouldoverthrow a democratically elected leader and replace them with a brutaldespot? Most observers would agree that any action of this sort wouldexempt any country from bearing the moniker “leader of the free world. ” It seems that, in addition to placing themselves where they shouldn’tbe, the United States, especially under Trump, has found ways to removethemselves precisely from where they should be. From the time of hiselection in 2016, Donald Trump made a concerted effort to do what canonly be described as worsen climate change. His rollbacks of 104environmental policies, though reversible, have unarguably causedmassive damage to the global climate. This damage cannot be undone. Perhaps the most telling evaluation of American damage to climate underTrump comes from Michael Gerrard of Columbia Law School. “Donald Trumphas been to climate regulation as General Sherman was to Atlanta. ”General William Sherman burned Atlanta to the ground. On the globalscale, Trump also removed the United States from the Paris ClimateAccord, at a time when their rivals and allies alike pledged to meetambitious emissions goals. This trend shows no signs of declining. Regardless of Joe Biden’s climate change policies, it’s unlikely thatany Republican president would preserve or build on such policies, asseen in George Bush’s prompt exit from the Kyoto Protocol following hiselection. In a country where the Republican Party is very much alive andthriving, there is little to no guarantee of significant climate actionfor any substantial amount of time. This outright disregard for the world and humanity as a whole should, byany standard, prevent the United States from being regarded as the“leader of the free world. ” However, perhaps more than anything, thegreatest barrier between America and this title is that it can hardly beconsidered a free country. On the surface, the idea of free elections doesn’t seem complex:citizens voicing their political opinions via the ballot. Yet it seemsthe United States has a problem with this, given their recentlyincreased usage of a wide arsenal of voter suppression techniques. One of the largest examples of this is felon disenfranchisement. Moststates prevent felons from voting even after they are out of prison fora time, and some states prevent convicted felons from voting for life. Estimates place the number of Americans deprived of the right to vote bythis at 4. 7 million, 77% of whom are no longer in prison (A. Rao, 2019). One could also reasonably state that this is a racist policy, withAfrican American voters four times more likely to be barred from votingthan other Americans. This and other practices, such as voter purging and gerrymandering,contribute to the finding that, compared with other liberal democracies,the United States is ranked second-to-last on an electoral integrityindex maintained by Harvard University and the University of Sydney. The most important fact is that this pattern does not stop with theUnited States. Many different forms of hypocritical self-marketing innature is present all throughout the world, whether it be thepropagation of a country’s unprecedented prosperity or a company’slaudable ethics. The societal complacency that follows diminishes ourability to hold these enterprises accountable and consequently haltsadvancement. Therefore, it is by developing a deep awareness of thesesocietal flaws and thinking for oneself, that true evolution and ethicalleadership can take shape. Perhaps with these characteristics in mind, acountry that is a true global leader will one day emerge. Photo by Joshua Hoehne, from Unsplash. "

    "body": "2020/12/17 - Do you know what “sonder” means? Don’t worry if you don’t; it’s a wordthat’s not even in the dictionary. It was first coined in 2012 by authorJohn Koenig, whose project The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows aims tocome up with new words for emotions that currently lack words. Sonder isdefined in Koenig’s book as, “the realization that each random passerbyis living a life just as vivid and complex as your own - populated withtheir own ambitions, friends, routines, losses, worries and craziness. ” I’m grateful for this term, because sonder is a feeling I know but havenever been able to name, until now. It’s especially reminiscent oflooking out over the city from the top of a Toronto skyscraper, seeingcars below me like ants on a sidewalk, people walking around the size ofpinpricks. Looking down on so much life makes you think about the namesand experiences behind all those faces. As human beings, we all gothrough many challenges. But do we ever extend this knowledge outwards,thinking that because we experience so much, so does everyone else?It’s a hard concept to grasp. To consider the fact that all we are andeverything we think is reconfigured in every single little pinprick of aperson, only differentiated by their experiences and past, isoverwhelming. It’s a realization that - no matter how much you thinkabout it - is not possible to fully comprehend. This is no fault of ourown; it just means that we cannot fully understand the value and depthof others’ lives unless we experience every detail ourselves, and thisis impossible. This brings me to a story that is popular at this time of year: AChristmas Carol, by Charles Dickens. This famous Christmas story is ofScrooge, a cold and unsympathetic man who is visited by the ghosts ofChristmas Past, Present, and Future. These spirits take him through hisown timeline to remind him that what you do can have a colossal impacton the lives of others. This realization drives Scrooge to understandthe meaning behind others’ lives, and that people can be going throughincredibly difficult situations without ever making it apparent. He thusbecomes a better person, with stronger senses of generosity andkindness. This story relates to the term ‘sonder’ because it teachesthat other people’s lives are much more complex and difficult than weknow, just as the definition of the word states. By learning this,Scrooge is able to change for the better and help people rather thanhinder them. But why is this important for us to realize? Every single day, we impact the lives of others whether we realize it ornot. Impacting someone else’s life can be as simple as giving a homelessperson a dollar, smiling at someone on the street, or telling a lovedone you care about them. It can also include being rude to a bus driverbecause you’re having a bad day, cutting in front of someone in a line,or honking your horn at another car when driving. Good or bad, all thesethings end up making a difference in someone else’s life, no matter howsmall this difference may be. This is the astute declaration that sonderbrings with it, despite being a term for a quiet kind of sorrow; it alsodemands that upon realizing that everyone is living a life as motley asyour own, you must do what you can to ensure you don’t make someone’slife more difficult. This is why the term sonder is especially important today, in thisfascinating and unparalleled year. We all know that 2020 has broughtchallenges that no one could have foreseen, and we’re all strugglingwith the continuation of COVID-19. Yet we must remember that despitewhat we are personally dealing with because of COVID-19, we are notalone in our difficulties. There are people we may meet once, or neverat all, who are in equally or even more difficult situations thanourselves. We must carry this realization with us throughout our lives,because it teaches us true empathy and understanding. It can drive us tobe more compassionate and more aware of what we do each day, even in thesmallest of ways. To understand sonder is also to change yourperspective, and reconsider your life in terms of the fact that you arenot alone in what you deal with, and you never have been. To leave you with imagery that truly captures the sorrow of the term,imagine being on a city street at night, looking up at a tall building. It’s a snowy evening, with people bundled up in coats and scarves,streetlights brightened and buses passing loudly; above you, rising highinto the cold air, an apartment building spotted with brightly litwindows. It is in imagining this situation that you must think of allthe lives bustling around you. The people passing on the street aregoing somewhere, and they too are thinking of how cold they are, butalso about whatever’s troubling them, which could be anything from mathhomework to a dying family member in the hospital. You will never know,but you must realize that this is something you cannot see. The peopleon the bus are heading somewhere; maybe home from work after a long day,maybe to see someone that they miss, maybe to go visit friends; the busdriver, too, is perhaps sick and tired of carting people around all day. Above you, in the lit apartment windows, people are warming up after along day outside, sitting on furniture they may have laboured overputting together, or spent time saving up to buy. Maybe they areexperiencing a pivotal moment in their lives; having a monumental fight,or celebrating a birthday with loved ones. The fact is, you will simplynever know. To them, you are a passerby too; a pinprick on the streetwhen looking out a window, a blur as the bus passes and turns a corner,or a bundled-up somebody on the street that they overlook and never seeagain. To understand sonder is to feel overwhelmed by this realization, to knowthat you can do nothing to slow the flow of complicated existence takingplace all around you. You are but one single person in a world ofbillions. Sonder is a sorrow because it is almost painful to know thatthere is so much life and joy yet so much loss and pain in the world,all of which you will never be aware of. To conclude, I want to leave you with the full definition of sonder; Ionly provided part of it in the beginning of this article to explain theterm’s intensity without simply stating so. As the original definitionfrom John Koenig’s Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows eloquently describes,“Sonder is the realization that each random passerby is living a life asvivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions,friends, routines, losses, worries and craziness—an epic story thatcontinues invisibly around you, with elaborate passageways to thousandsof other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appearonly once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur oftraffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk. ” Image Source: “Minneapolis, United States” by Josh Hild frompexels. com "

    "title": "MCI Pandemic Perspectives",
    "body": "2020/12/07 - We posed a list of relevant questions to MCI students at each gradelevel, once in May, then again in November. These students gave briefresponses, accounting for their unique experiences over the past fewmonths. The goal was to recognize the different perspectives amongpeople, even though they’re all from one community. We wanted to showhow drastically different our lives are now than they were when thepandemic first began. We hope you might be interested to know how othersat MCI were affected, and how it might differ from your experiences. What was your first impression/how did you feel when first hearing about the virus?: Grade 9: My first impression on hearing about the virus was that itwas important, but not as much of a global issue as it turned out to be. It seemed to be somewhere in the middle between a simple flu and a bigvirus; something we needed to take precautions to avoid, but not a majorissue. I never thought that it would reach pandemic level because itwasn’t made to seem that serious. Grade 10: Initially, like most people, I wasn’t too concerned. Ithought because the virus wasn’t in Canada we didn’t have much to worryabout. However, when we started to get cases over here I wasn’tdistressed, but I was apprehensive to be in large groups or near peoplewho seemed to be sick. Grade 11: When I first heard about the virus, I didn’t think it wouldbecome as big of a deal as it did. But as it got worse and worse I wasshocked at how it got out of hand so quickly. I was just praying that itdidn’t hit Canada like it was hitting countries in Europe, like Italyand China. Grade 12: Personally, when I first heard about the virus months ago, Ididn’t think it was too serious. It wasn't something I really worriedabout until it got more severe. Follow Up: How do you currently feel about the pandemic situation?: Grade 9: I am not too bothered by the pandemic situation at themoment. We are still doing school, which I prefer in quads, and themajor difference is that you can not go out and socialize. I miss that,but I am still able to communicate with my friends on video games andsocial media as well as at school. Grade 10: The pandemic has been around for months now and it’s hardnot to be a little tired of our current situation. I am still veryconcerned with COVID and I am diligent in my safety measures, howeverI’m finding it taxing mentally and I’m hopeful we will have this undercontrol soon. Grade 11: It still upsets me quite a bit. But at this point as I’m ingrade 12, all I am really hoping is that I can start university withoutany/a lot of restrictions. I really want to be able to go into schooland have frosh. I’ve gotten used to it as well, and in some waysforgotten what life was like before the virus, which I guess is sad butis also normal. I really loved summer because I was working andconstantly seeing people at work which was nice, and now it’s niceschool is open. I just wish it was more than every other day or less ifyou have a spare. In short, I feel better, but my feelings haven’treally changed. I find it hard to be optimistic on a day to day basis. Grade 12: I think I have grown pretty used to being in a pandemic. Iwish it would end so I could stop doing uni online and not have to hearthe phrase “unprecedented times” ever again. How are you adjusting to life at home?: Grade 9: I actually like working on my schoolwork at home. It isgiving me more independence and time management skills, which I thinkare valuable. Also, I like the fact that I am able to work on my ownagenda; if I finish something in 25 minutes, I am able to move on tosomething else rather than do nothing until the period ends. Thisactually reduces the time I spend on work and I am able to finish quiteearly. I do miss socializing with my friends, but I am still findingways to communicate through social media and video games. It is tough attimes, but not unbearable, and I try to make the most of it. Grade 10: Life at home is positive. It can be challenging, being stuckwith your family for too long can do that sometimes. So far I’m copingwith it fairly well. Grade 11: Originally I had a hard time adjusting to not being able tosee people and especially my friends. But after the first few weeks Isettled into it. It’s weird because the days feel short and I lose trackof time easier but I’ve gotten used to it in a way. I still don’t likeit though to be honest. Grade 12: For the most part, I’m enjoying my time in self-isolation,sleeping in, and watching Netflix has become a regular part of myschedule. I have been able to spend quality time with my family andwhile I miss my friends a lot (shout out to the gang&lt;3), they’re onlyone call away. However, I have to say online school may be the worstthing I have to go through in quarantine :( Follow Up: How is life at home currently?: Grade 9: I enjoy working at home because it allows me to work on myown schedule. I get bored at times at home but I am always able to findthings to do so that is not a major issue. Grade 10: Life at home is good, I’m always finding new things to doand projects to finish. It’s just hard always being in the same place. Ihave gotten pretty sick of my bedroom after all of these weeks. Grade 11: I’ve honestly been really enjoying living at home. Sometimesit gets boring and repetitive, but I enjoy spending time with my family. I’ve noticed that I’ve become more introverted in a lot of ways so I’veadapted to it more. I’m honestly turning into a homebody! Grade 12: Life at home is good! As I hear about the prospect ofanother lockdown, I feel pretty annoyed, but not really at the lockdownitself. Instead, I am annoyed at people who acted like the pandemic wasover back in September and October, and took no time to consider howtheir actions may affect others. I hope this lockdown will be short andis effective in reminding people they have to be responsible. Give three words to describe the current pandemic situation. : Grade 9: People making adjustments Grade 10: Chaotic, Mysterious, Daunting Grade 11: Futuristic, Chaotic, Mayhem Grade 12: Surreal, Hopeful, Lonely Follow Up: Give three words to describe the pandemic situation. : Grade 9: Work in progress Grade 10: Strenuous, Complicated, Exhausting Grade 11: Hazy chaotic mess Grade 12: Wild, Isolating, Insightful What is one piece of advice you wish you could give to yourself before this all started happening?: Grade 9: I would probably tell myself to do more, and to be moreinvolved with things, because all this time is making me realize that Iam missing doing all of these things, and I could have been doing them. An example would be volunteering. I easily could have volunteered more,and now that I can’t, I am regretting not doing it before. Grade 10: Get bubble tea before it's too late. Also, don’t leave yourmath textbook in your locker over March Break because you can’t get itback now. Grade 11: Don’t stress as much and live in the moment. I know thatsounds cheesy but it’s true. One thing that this has really taught me isthat time is so valuable and unexpected things always get in the way ofyour plans. Grade 12: I want my pre- epidemic grade 12 self to know that theyshould have lived more in the moment when they had the chance, and nothave pushed experiences they really wanted to have to summer 2020because they were too focused on university or job applications. Follow Up: Would you change the piece of advice you gave to yourself back in May, and if so, how?: Grade 9: No I wouldn’t because I think that for the most part I haveused the advice and tried to take advantage of the virtual clubs andopportunities so that I am more involved. Grade 10: Yes I would change that advice. First of all you don’t needbubble tea, and your math textbook will be fine. Pick up a good book anduse this time to do something you love. Don’t just waste these days,they still count. Grade 11: Not really. I agree with what I said. If I had known thingswould change and this virus would last more than 3 weeks, I think Iwould have changed the way I was living-- less worried about whatothers think because that wastes too much time. Grade 12: I don't think I would change my advice, but I would add toit. First, I would want to tell myself that even when I feel alone,there will always be people around me who I can talk to. They wereprobably feeling the same way I was. Second, I would also add somethingabout making a schedule for yourself, otherwise, you willprocrastinate. Finally, I would tell myself to stay positive and focuson myself&lt;3 What is the thing you miss the most about school, activities, and just going out in general?: Grade 9: I really miss just seeing people, and being in a differentsetting. I can still communicate online, but it’s still not the same astalking to your friends in person, or carpooling with friends. That iswhat I am missing most. I am also missing changing my setting. The factthat I can’t go to places and do things makes me realize how much I likegoing to those places and doing those things. Mainly, I am referring tosoccer. I am a soccer player, and I really miss being out there with myteam, practicing, and playing. That will be the first thing I want to doafter the pandemic situation eases. Grade 10: The thing I miss most about going out would probably be thevariety. There was always something different everyday, what I wasdoing, who I saw, whether or not we had strings with Stoica that day. Now I find myself waking up and doing the same thing everyday. It wouldjust be great to see some fresh faces and not resort to watching Gleefor 4 hours straight. I miss the variation the most. Grade 11: My friends! I miss seeing them so much and video calling isdefinitely not the same as seeing them in person. Grade 12: The thing I miss the most about school is everyday humaninteraction, which I often took for granted. I wish I made the most ofall the clubs and activities in that final week of school because Ididn’t know they were going to be my last. Despite my final year beingcut short, the experiences I had and people I met at MCI have had a hugeimpact on me and I will really miss being part of it. Follow Up: What’s one thing you currently miss about “normal” life?: Grade 9: The one thing I miss most about is going out and socializingwith people face to face, and also being able to go into restaurants andstores. I also miss being able to go out without a mask. Grade 10: The biggest thing would be seeing my family and friends. FaceTime and Zoom do not do justice to seeing people in real life. Hopefully soon things will turn around and my interaction with them willbe more frequent. Grade 11: I miss seeing my friends, and going to school to see people!Like all the time! It makes me so sad that there are so many people Imay not get to see at all this year :( Grade 12: One thing I miss about normal life which I took for grantedis getting to see my friends face-to-face almost every day. Now it’salways over Zoom, and if I do see them, it’s only every once in a while. "

    "title": "Knowledge is Power: Why to Stay Informed During the Pandemic",
    "body": "2020/05/15 - If there is one word to describe the world we live in today, it wouldbe, “uncertain. ” Uncertain of what to do, where to go next, and what isgoing to happen in the near future. Everywhere we turn, the words“virus” and “pandemic” flood our ears, making it incredibly challengingto think of anything else. It may be tempting to try to block out theworld altogether to avoid bad news, but one thing to remember is that wemust stay informed during these times. We have to stay on top ofinformation regarding our global situation, for a number of validreasons.   For one, keeping updated is a way to do our part to stop the spread ofthe virus. We all have an important role to play within our communities. We have to look out for ourselves, and those around us. You may hear thephrase, “we’re all in this together” quite often, and wonder what itmeans. Obviously we’re not physically together, and isolation makes itfeel like we’re actually farther apart. And no, it’s not a High SchoolMusical reference. This phrase is meant to convey that everyone iscurrently going through the same situation. It means we all need toremain united against a common threat, and work to keep ourselves andthe community safe. This can be achieved through listening to our publichealth officials, and taking proper precautions, like social distancing. One can only be aware of these precautions by keeping up with the news,and staying informed.   Another reason to stay informed is knowing how to respond to challengesduring this time. Most of the world, let alone all MCI students, havenever been part of any pandemic situation before. No one knows how toact or where to begin trying to cope with all the changes. These changescause many to feel scared, helpless and not in control. By stayinginformed on new developments of the virus, as well as the necessaryprecautions to take, you are educating yourself on how to combat our newreality. This education becomes a way to feel in control, and stay ontop of the fear. A study conducted by the International Journal ofEnvironmental Research and Public Health (IJERPH) found that those whohad reliable and updated information regarding the coronavirus felt moreprepared to handle it. Also, people who received accurate informationabout the virus had lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression. Sowhen staying updated on information concerning the virus, not only areyou learning about ways to react, but you are possibly improving thestatus of your mental health. By learning more about what threatens us,we can combat fear, and remain feeling in control.   Another major reason to remain informed is to stay connected with theoutside world. Through television, newspapers, and the internet, we areable to momentarily escape our self-isolation and see what is happeningthroughout the globe. For example, by watching the news, not only areyou getting information, you are seeing the contrasting effects of thevirus around the world. You get to see what other people are doing, andhow other countries are reacting. Most importantly, you get to bereminded that you are not alone, since the whole world is going throughthe same thing. Getting information and updates is your ticket toexperiencing the world once again, because it allows you to see whatothers are doing.   Finally, although our world may seem scary and uncertain, it is also onethat will go down in the history books. People will remember these pastfew months as the worst crisis since WWII, meaning we are all makinghistory. I’d like to believe our children or even grandchildren may askabout this time; how it felt to live in self-isolation, be off fromschool, and watch everything around us shut down. In order to speak toour experiences, we should be aware of what’s happening throughout theworld. Even though this crisis is terrible, we should be immersingourselves in the current information and updates, so we remember whenit’s over. Those who weren’t present during this time will want to knoweverything, and I, for one, want to be able to share it. So, think aboutit like this: staying informed is a way to truly be a part of thisevent, and if we don’t know what’s going on around us, we may be lettinga historic occurrence pass us by.   To conclude, it is really important to remain informed and updated aboutthe virus, as well as other current events around the world. Now, thisdoesn’t mean glueing yourself to the TV or reading every newspaperarticle. You can be informed by just watching the news once a day, for abrief period of time. Alternately, you can go online to the Globe andMail, the New York Times, the Washington Post, or countless othernewspaper sources, and read a couple articles. By taking ten minutes outof each day, you can learn so much about what is happening around you. Being informed is all about feeling confident and resilient enough to goabout your daily life, without feeling worried. We must remember thateven in a world of uncertainty, there are ways to fight back, and remainin control.   Sources: https://cmha. bc. ca/covid-19-stay-informed/   https://www. mdpi. com/1660-4601/17/5/1729 Image Source: “The New York Times Newspaper” by cottonbro from Pexels "

    "title": "Female Representation in Journalism: A Harsh Reality ",
    "body": "2020/05/15 - Imagine you get a job in your dream field of work. You start off well,yet after a while, you realize that your role in the company is notadvancing and your work is being limited. This is how women injournalism feel on a daily basis. Despite the major strides maderegarding gender equality, the world of journalism is still veryimbalanced when it comes to the representation of males versus females. In recent years, studies and data have shown that there are more femalesmaking up journalism students in universities and colleges. Yet, femalesonly make up 39% of newsrooms. Therefore, the news is predominantlycovered by men.   A lot of this imbalance in representation comes from past and currentgender stereotypes. In 2016, it was reported that in the United States,fields of reporting with over 50% of female representation includedlifestyle, education, and healthcare. Whereas, there was less that 30%of female representation in topics such as sports, weather, and crimeand justice. In Canadian newsrooms, many major news organizations havealso shown large gender gaps, according to a 2015 study. The GlobalMedia Monitoring Project looked into 23 Canadian news organizations,including CBC, CTV, the Toronto Star, and the Globe and Mail. They found that only 43% of reporters were female, and that only 31% ofwomen reporters had covered stories regarding politics and government. Additionally, the study found that women were more likely than men toinclude female sources in their articles.   You must be wondering: Why is equal representation in the newsimportant? One major reason that gender equality in the media matters isbecause women bring new and different perspectives to journalism,sparking more interest in global news and creating a broader audience. The Women’s Media Center put out a study in 2017, outlining theconsequences of a lack of female representation in journalism. The studystated that in 12 top U. S. news outlets, campus sexual assault storieswere mainly written by men. In these stories, male journalists were morelikely to focus on the impact on the perpetrator, and his behavioursurrounding rape charges. On the other hand, female journalists whocovered sexual assault were more likely to focus on the victim’sbehaviour, and how rape impacted them. This is just one examplerevealing a difference in perspective that occurs when the same type ofstory is covered by a man or a woman. Women also emphasize differentideas than men. A study in 2013 found that women writing editorialpieces prominently used words including abuse, assault, children,equality, education, discrimination, and violence. This difference insubject matter and perspective is important to have in the media,especially in news and broadcasting. It provides a more detailed andcomprehensive story, helping the audience to become better-informed.   Now, there is one major question left: Is it possible to have equalrepresentation in newsrooms, and how can we achieve it? Firstly, it isTOTALLY possible to represent males and females equally in journalism!The world of reporting, broadcasting, and news would be far better ifthere were many contrasting perspectives on world issues. Journalismcould be elevated from what it is now, to keep national and globalaudiences engaged and well-informed. To achieve this proper balance, wecan be aware of the challenges that women in journalism face, and standup for their right to equal representation and opportunities. We can useour voices, as well as social media platforms to advocate for thiscause, and inform those around us about the issue.   Image Source: “Woman Writing in Notebook” by Ivan Samkov from Pexels "

    "body": "2020/05/01 - The latest conflict between the Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs and theirsupporters, and those supporting the Coastal GasLink Pipeline hasrevealed that Canada remains set in its role as a colonizer. Before thebeginning of this year, it may have been easy to deny that Canadaremains a colonizing power, but no longer can that appeal to ignorancebe made.   For those unfamiliar with the situation, here are the main events. Atthe beginning of this year, following a Dec. 31st injunction from theB. C. Supreme Court, militarized RCMP officers raided a camp of FirstNations land defenders, arresting people on their sovereign territory. In reaction, protesters led demonstrations and blocked railways acrossthe country.   The actions of these protesters and the original Wet'suwet'en landdefenders have been highly criticized across Canada in ways that aremisguided and problematic. The record must be set straight. An RCMP raid on Wet’suwet’en land amounts to an invasion of a foreignnation. According to the Canadian law and the United Nations Declarationon the Rights of Indigenous People, these land defenders have the rightto self-governance and territorial sovereignty.   This is an act of colonial exploitation. Canada is a colonial power. Canada was created to extract natural resources. To do this, theCanadian Government along with private corporations killed, ethnicallycleansed, and commited cultural genocide against First Nations people. We saw this in Residential Schools, in the Sixties Scoop and we continueto see it today. This was done to free up land for both resourceextraction and settlers to do the work. It is inherently racist andmorally abhorrent in every way.   A common misconception is that the pipeline is legitimate and acceptedbecause the elected band council system has okayed it. It must berecognized though, that the elected band council is a system put intoplace by the Indian Act to make band councils more similar to othercolonial governments. According to the traditional Wet'suwet'en systemof government, the Hereditary Chiefs are the true and legitimateleaders. This has been upheld by the Supreme Court. Finally, putting all this aside, there should be no pipelines. At all. Anywhere. We are in a climate emergency. Arguments are made about theeconomy and the need to slowly ease off fossil fuels. Unfortunately, thetime for that is long gone. Science says we need to stop producing oiland natural gas now. Many Canadians are unaware of these issues, but it has becomeincreasingly important in political discourse in recent years. Recentmovement towards “Reconciliation” would have the average citizen believethat Canada and its government have ceased colonial actions and areworking to right the wrongs done over the past 400 years. This mostrecent conflict clearly shows that the government cares not forIndigenous Peoples’ rights when there is money to be made. Reconciliation is a farce while colonization continues. Knowing this,when you stand for O Canada, ask yourself: Do you stand for colonialism?Do you stand for cultural genocide? Do you stand for ignoring humanrights? If not, consider staying seated.   *Opinion Piece * Image source: “Wet'suwet'en Solidarity Event - Rail Yard near PioneerVillage Station Blockaded - Vaughan, Toronto, Ontario - February 15,2020. ” By Jason Hargrove fromFlickr "

    "body": "2020/04/30 - Recently, I picked up the book Mindset by Carol Dweck and becameobsessed. While I run the risk of being melodramatic, I must say thatthis book has offered me a new perspective on life and a solution to aproblem that I once thought unsolvable. Now, before I go into anyfurther details, I want to ask you, the reader, a question. Do you thinkthat intelligence is something you are born with or something you candevelop?  Before reading this book I always believed that intelligence, amongother attributes, was a fixed value that couldn’t be altered. I believedthat while hard work could allow you to accomplish more, it wouldn’tchange your inherent aptitude for something. For example, when I woulddo poorly on a math or science test (and trust me this happened far toooften), I would tell myself that “science just wasn’t my thing. ” Theproblem with this mentality is that it didn't allow room for growth. Inmy head, it felt irrational and too challenging to constantly put moreeffort into science. Sure, I could study a week in advance for everyscience test, but what was the point? I didn’t want to keep putting myblood, sweat and tears into science just to stay on par with the rest ofmy marks, or peers (who I believed had natural aptitudes for science). What I didn’t understand though, is that nobody can sustainably excel atsomething without putting work in. Intelligence and skills can becultivated in almost every facet of your life. Personality,intelligence, athletic ability, social skills etc. can all be developed,over time, through hard work, good strategies and input from others.  By viewing our attributes, and others', as fixed values, we are forcedto place our self-esteem on our natural abilities alone. So, when facedwith failure, we are devastated as we believe that we will neverovercome them fully. Conversely, with a growth mindset, you spend lesstime worrying about how talented or  good  at something you are andfocus instead on learning and growing your abilities. Often, when facedwith criticism or failure, we retract into feelings of insecurity anddefensiveness, which directly inhibits our growth and opportunity tolearn from our mistakes. People are born with an inherent love forlearning, but a fixed mindset, derived from society's institutionalizedhabit of praising natural ability, ruins this. We live in a world wherewe believe people are either innately superior or inferior and,therefore, we stick to easy tasks that we excel in, to repeatedly affirmour feelings of superiority, while simultaneously avoiding things thatexpose our inferiority. We sweep under the rug, the parts of our lifethat need the most nurturing and attention, leaving them more neglectedand weak than ever before. With this behaviour, we slam the door on anychance of genuine improvement and growth by letting our conquerableweaknesses constantly hold us back from our true potential. For this new year, I urge you to reignite your passion for learning byletting go of your fear of failure through the belief that skills andability can be grown and cultivated. Unfortunately, I can't get intoall the nitty-gritty details about what a growth mindset is and how toachieve it (it’ll take up the entire Beacon), so I strongly urge you toread Dr. Dweck's book. It’s important to note though that real change and improvement will takecommitment and patience. You can’t expect to immediately flourish atsomething you are weak in, just by suddenly putting more effort in. Itwill take dedication and time to hone your skills and help them developto the standard at which you want them. The main idea is to not getdiscouraged. When I first took on this mindset, believe it or not, Iperformed worse than I usually do. But instead of giving up, I pressedon and used my low marks to determine my mistakes and how to betterprepare in the future. If you are reading this and somehow haven’t gotten bored from myrambling, I sincerely hope that you are motivated and interested intaking up this new attitude and perspective on life. Our world needsmore growth-minded people than ever before, as we live in a world withinfinite possibilities and challenges that can only be overcome by thosemost willing to try. As I wrap this up, I'll leave you with one lastpiece of advice: NEVER - especially in the face of adversity - fixate onyour present ability, but instead on your potential, what is possibleand what you can become.

    "body": "2020/04/30 - COVID-19 is spreading quickly - so quickly, in fact, that by the timethis article is released, these statistics will already be out ofdate*. When news of the virus reached the international community, themajority of the coverage was focused on China, particularly on themillions under quarantine in the province of Hubei. However, by the endof February, there was news of outbreaks in South Korea, Italy, andIran. By mid-March, the majority of the world was under quarantine asoutbreaks spread across the world.   COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around the world, with over onemillion cases and 56,000 confirmed deaths. Canada currently has 12,000confirmed cases and over 170 deaths. The United States, however, hasquickly become an epicenter for the virus, with over 265,000 cases and6,700 deaths. An online polling survey by Leger suggests that Americansaren't taking isolation as seriously as Canadians - only 86% of USrespondents were adhering to the required 2 metre distance rules, incomparison to 95% of Canadians. Although this number might seem small,it could be a significant factor in determining the death tolls in bothcountries.   Disinformation is still prominent in the battle against COVID-19, andundermines public attempts to fight it. From online posts claiming thatlemons ward off the virus, to Fox News anchors saying that holding yourbreath for more than ten seconds will prevent it, disinformation iswidespread. Worse still, people’s attempts to try to make a profit offof selling their own home remedies do more than damage their personalcredibility - they can prevent individuals, who have the disease, fromgetting life-saving treatment. While choosing not to spread disinformation might be an easy choice,what the governments of the world are faced with today is far from easy. As the world goes into quarantine in an attempt to contain the spread ofthe virus, economic activity halts. This poses many problems, and it isinevitable that massive job losses follow.   In a one week period thisMarch, the government of Canada received nearly 500,000 applications forunemployment insurance, an amount only matched by an eight monthperiod during the recession in 2009. This presents a moral dilemma - achoice between people’s lives, and their livelihoods.   The governments of the world, as this crisis continues to unfold, willhave to tread carefully. Are they prepared to deal with a potentialdepression, and the mental health issues and business failures thatwould result from it? There are no easy answers, and this is not an easysituation. All we can do is stay safe as best we can, and practisesocial distancing for the good of our country and the world.   * This article was originally released on April 3rd, 2020.

    "body": "2020/04/30 - You’re on the bus, in a car, in your room, waiting at a doctor’s office,or just sitting around doing nothing. It’s not worth the effort to pullout a book, there’s no access to your favourite TV show, and you wantsomething a bit more rewarding than listening to music. The solutionーpodcasts! Podcasts are one of the most underappreciated forms of mediaout there. They are audio programs that focus on the spoken word, like aradio talk show but better. Podcasts are easily accessible, widelyavailable, and there is a podcast for everyone out there, whether you’relooking for lighthearted comedy, news and politics, or dramaticstorytelling. But where to start? In a day and age where time isliterally money and there are thousands of forms of entertainment allvying for your attention, it can seem overwhelming to decide what tochoose. That’s why I’m here to help! I’ve chosen a couple of my all timefavourite podcasts (and I listen to a lot of podcasts). So, whetheryou’re brand new to the world of podcasts or an experienced veteran,here are some of my suggestions that I hope each of you will at leastgive a try. Enjoy!  The Anthropocene Reviewed by John GreenThe Anthropocene Reviewed is a monthly podcast about all things human. In this podcast, John Green (author of The Fault in Our Stars amongother things) reviews anything and everything on a five star scale. Thetopics range from the QWERTY keyboard to velociraptors to teddy bears toSuper Mario Kart. On the surface it may seem like a shallow, fun-time,but it often delves deep into what connects us all and makes us humanthrough the lens of ridiculous and everyday objects and events. By theend of an episode about hot dog eating contests you may be having anexistential crisis about the worth of your own existence and why we’reall really here. Sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes uplifting, everyepisode is a new and delightful discovery about what it means to behuman. Episodes are about half an hour long and there’s no set order orplot, so you can pick it up anywhere, but you may find yourself bingelistening like I do. It’s one of my all time favourite podcasts becauseI love the juxtaposition of absurd topics and thoughtful discussion. It’ll make you laugh one moment and cry the next, which is why Irecommend The Anthropocene Reviewed.  Myths and Legends by Jason and Carissa WeiserMyths and Legends is a weekly podcast retelling old musty myths in anew, funky way. This podcast aims to tell stories, from (in)famous taleslike Robin Hood and Hansel and Gretel to ones you may have neverheard of but will love, like The Eyrie and Meng Jiangnu and the GreatWall. It also features a “Creature of the Week” segment, discussingfoolish and fantastical creatures from myths all over the world. JasonWeiser recounts these tales in a way that’s entertaining, funny, andkeeps you on the edge of your seat. This podcast is an old favourite ofmine because it’s lighthearted and comforting, like a good chickennoodle soup. Myths and Legends is something that I go back to time andagain because it’s casual enough to listen to while doing chores orother mind numbing tasks, funny and entertaining, but still carry alesson. Episodes are usually half an hour to an hour long; some storiessplit into sagas several episodes long, but most are individualinstallments you can pick and choose from. I’d recommend Myths andLegends to anyone looking for an interesting and educationalstorytelling podcast.  Science Vs by Gimlet MediaScience Vs is a weekly podcast that examines controversial topics in ascience focused way. Narrated by Wendy Zuckerman and produced by GimletMedia, this podcast covers many topics, from police shootings to killerasteroids to the coronavirus to vaping. It’s a great surface levelintroduction to these topics and many more, debating the pros and consand often bringing in experts to talk about them. Science Vs is botheducational and entertaining to listen to, and the topics are often veryrelevant to current events or everyday life. I like the informationalyet conversational tone of the podcast and that it gives a generic ideaof the topic without going too in depth, so it can be informativewithout feeling stuffy and formal. Episodes are about an hour long andstand alone, so you can listen to just what piques your interest withoutbeing dragged down by over a hundred episodes. I’d recommend ScienceVs to anyone interested in learning something new in a fun and engagingway. I encourage you to go explore podcasts on Spotify, Soundcloud, or anyother digital platform. Happy podcasting!  Image sources:“Anthropocene Reviewed” fromjohngreenbooks. com “Science Vs” from gimletmedia. com “Myths and Legends” frommythpodcast. com "

    "body": "2020/04/04 - Hey Bears! Earth Hour 2020 (Saturday March 28th, 2020, at 8:30 pm)is rapidly approaching. You probably already know what Earth Hour is,and you might think that it’s somewhat silly.   Nobody actually believes that a bunch of people turning off somelights for one hour is going to change anything, do they? And our schoolcan’t really participate anyway. The timing doesn’t allow it and if weturn off our lights, the school will be plunged into darkness. Indeed, it is an unfortunate truth that MCI’s notorious lack of windowsand natural lighting makes it difficult for us to celebrate Earth Hour. And yes, we obviously can’t “properly” participate because there’s noschool on the 28th. There won’t ever be school during Earth Hour, sinceit takes place in the evening and on the last Saturday of March. Regardless, MCI and many other schools do their bit on the Fridaybefore. But the question still remains - does Earth Hour make a difference?According to the mission statement of EarthHour. org, (the officialwebsite for… well, Earth Hour), the main purpose of Earth Hour is tomake a symbolic commitment to the betterment of our environment. Theevent is meant to “spark global conversations on protecting nature notonly to combat the climate crisis, but to ensure our own health,happiness, prosperity and even survival. ” The carbon emission reduction of the event is indeed negligible (Gollom,2014), but millions of people across 180 countries participate in EarthHour every year, meaning they have taken the time out of their day toconsider how they as individuals can impact the planet.   Yes, Earth Hour is simplistic. Anyone can do it and the second it’sover, we can continue on with our wasteful, energy-guzzling, consumerlifestyles. But for that brief hour, people are acting in unity for ourenvironment. Any act of positive unity in our increasingly morecomplicated society is a moment to be cherished. So if you can, pleasedo consider participating in Earth Hour 2020 with your families andconserve energy whenever possible to carry on the spirit ofenvironmental stewardship. Energy conservation tips include: turning off lights that are not inuse, unplugging appliances that are not in use (yeah it’s annoying toplug them in again, but come on! That’s a first world problem if I everheard one) and changing to energy efficient lights and appliances (thistip does depend on how cool your parents are, of course). The internetis at your fingertips for more information on how you can make adifference, of course.   Happy Earth Hour, MCI!

    "title": "The Don Cherry Divide",
    "body": "2020/02/01 - The winter holidays are a time to embrace the spirit of togetherness, bemerry, and spend time with family. Unfortunately, something happened inNovember that has quickly become one of the most heated issues in Canada(and could lead to awkward conversations with the extended family aroundthe dinner table). This event was the firing of Don Cherry. You’veprobably heard about this, but in case you haven’t, here is a briefrundown of what happened. On Remembrance Day, the 85-year-old NHLcommentator went after immigrants in Toronto and Mississauga, accusingthem of not wearing poppies and not honouring Canada’s veterans. Undoubtedly the part that drew the most criticism was his use of thewords “you people. ” The statement quickly drew widespread criticism, and Sportsnet fired DonCherry. Don Cherry, throughout his history as a broadcaster, has had ahistory of making very controversial statements. These instances includethe time when he complained about “wom[e]n yapping away” at hockeygames or when he said vulgar things about Liberals at the 2010 inauguralmeeting of Toronto’s new city council, describing the Liberal media as“left-wing pinkos”, and “kooks”. One of the things that may have contributed to Cherry’s firing was hisunwillingness to apologize. In an interview he did with Fox News, hesaid that he might have used different wording if he could have done itover, but came nowhere near giving a formal apology. Not only were Cherry’s comments offensive, but they were inaccurate andcounterproductive. While the sentiment of getting people to appreciateall that our veterans have sacrificed for Canada is good, Cherry failedto take into account that immigrants are also part of the Canadianmilitary. Sergeant Stephen Thomas, 37, is a first-generation Canadianwith parents from Guyana, who served two tours in Afghanistan, and wasshocked by Cherry’s comments. He said: “I don’t think he’s realized howmuch the military has changed over the last decade or two. ” The reason Don Cherry was fired was that his comments, whetherintentional or unintentional (as his supporters claim), hurt people. Hisracist, sexist, and rude comments throughout the years may have been fewand far between, but the fact that he was unwilling to apologize says alot about his character. His firing is a stepping stone in slowlygetting rid of the voices of discrimination better left in the past. Onthis holiday, in the spirit of togetherness, we should all recognizewhat Cherry could not - that no matter what country we were born in, weare all Canadian.

    "body": "2020/02/01 - A guide to tree-ting this season right (filled with history,controversies, and more!) It has begun. Everyone has simultaneously agreed, as if some telepathicphenomenon has occurred, and set out to accomplish one thing. 98. 1 CHFIhas Toronto’s Christmas Music Station; stores have transformed to fitconsumer holiday needs; Canada’s Wonderland has created Winterfest; andso on. However, the question comes to mind: are you completely prepared forthe holiday season? If you answered no, read this guide! If you answeredyes, read this guide! ReSPECT; don’t ReGIFT! Regifting- although harmless when done thoughtfully- requires carefulattention and etiquette. There are certain rules one must pay heed towhen committing such an act. Firstly, never regift anything meaningfulor handmade. Doing this will transform you into a Grinch! Secondly,regift outside of your circle of friends. This avoids awkward tensionand does not hurt the original gift-giver. Thirdly, regiftthoughtfully. For example, you would not regift a Crock-Pot to your7-year old brother; you would give it to your mom who is in need of one. “When in doubt, regift to charity. ” This saying avoids many conflictsand is a solution towards a greater good. Simply storing the gift orthrowing it away because you got the Crock-Pot 99 instead of Crock-Pot100, wastes many resources, time, and energy. Bake with a Canine Twist! What’s that I smell in your oven? Dog cookies! They are the motive thisseason. The world wide web consists of numerous recipes that you canfollow to bake such lovely treats. Please note that chocolate is a dogno-no! Controversy: Real or Fake? It has been debated out for an undocumented amount of time: should onebuy real or artificial Christmas trees? Firstly, if you have purchasedan artificial tree, reuse it for a long time to make itenvironmentally-friendly. You would have to use it for more than 20years to make it a more eco-friendly option. Real trees, however, havesurprising benefits to them. Christmas tree farms serve as a habitat forlocal wildlife, giving a home to many species. Around 350 million treesare grown on these farms, with 30 million being harvested. In theindustry continuum, these farms appear on the low end. However, it iscritical to compost or recycle your tree properly. If you’re feelingextra spicy, offer your tree to mulching and chipping programs, whichhelp grow more species for one’s garden. To conclude this controversy,buy a real, locally-grown tree. This also allows you to experience theprocess of picking the right one.

I’ll visit Doctors Without Borders, and make my contribution. I won’t leave people out, I’ll never be one to shun. That last line was pretty bad, I could have used “exclusion”.

Gone (too soon) are the orange andbrown leafy streets, the comforting sweater weather, the therapeuticfeeling of ordering a pumpkin spice latte albeit it's horrendous taste. Before those moments, we enjoyed the hot air, the feeling of no school,the beach outings, picnics in the parks, the gorgeous sunsets, thebeautiful long days, and the alluring shorts nights.

    "title": "A Year in Review: Ranking My Top 10 Films of 2019",
    "body": "2020/02/01 - Over the past twelve months, we were handed a diverse collection offilms. Be it comedies, thrillers, action movies, or dramas, filmmakersnew and old raised the bar for this medium in 2019. As the year comes toan end, I am taking a look back and ranking my top ten movies of theyear. I chose the films that challenged me as a viewer, made me thinkfor days after I watched it, and most importantly, films that were justreally fun to watch. 10. Climax Dir. Gasper Noé Climax follows a group of aspiringdancers in an abandoned school, as their rehearsal spirals out ofcontrol into madness. This film is a visually stunning, yet disturbingerotic rush from start to finish. 9. Shazam! Dir. David F. Sandberg From DC Comics, Shazam! follows14-year-old Billy Batson as he must learn how to deal with God-likesuperpowers. With family values at the core of this film and a stellarchild cast, Shazam! is the most heartwarming superhero film of the year. 8. Ad Astra Dir. James Gray Brad Pitt soars in this film whichexplores the powerful bond between a father and son. CinematographerHoyte van Hoytema delivers a visual spectacle of outer space. 7. The Peanut Butter Falcon Dir. Tyler Nilson, Michael Schwartz Ayoung man with down syndrome escapes his nursing facility with dreams ofattending a wrestling school. Shia LaBeouf is mesmerizing in thischarming homage to a Mark Twain classic. 6. Midsommar Dir. Ari Aster Midsommar is a confusing, thoughtprovoking, and ambitious film. Director Ari Aster creates anothermasterfully crafted horror film that almost rivals Aster’s previousclassic, Hereditary. 5. The Lighthouse Dir. Robert Eggers Robert Pattinson and WillemDafoe give strong performances in this wicked tale of two lighthousekeepers on a distant island in New England. Robert Eggers reallysolidifies himself as a strong filmmaker in the horror genre with thisfilm. 4. Rocketman Dir. Dexter Fletcher Taron Egerton gives his bestperformance yet with Rocketman. I think it's going to be a long longtime until another film succeeds in creating a movie musical biopic asintense as Rocketman. 3. Booksmart Dir. Olivia Wilde Olivia Wilde’s directorial debut is acoming-of-age comedy between two best friends and academic‘overachievers’ who realize that they’ve wasted their high school yearsslaving away instead of having fun. Booksmart is a wild and fast-pacedmovie that is clever in its portrayal of teenagers. 2. Joker Dir. Todd Phillips Joker is a heartbreaking and brutaltake on the clown prince of crime’s origin story. Todd Phillips drawsheavy inspiration from films such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedyto construct his tale of a man disregarded by society. Phillips’s Gothamis corrupt and crime ridden, but it’s the realism that helps amplify thefilm’s critique of a society that dismisses its citizens. JoaquinPhoenix gives a disturbing performance as Arthur Fleck that at times maycall on the viewer to sympathize with him but strictly acknowledges hisvile actions. Todd Phillip’s direction and Lawrence Sher’s beautifulcinematography accompanied by HildurGuðnadóttir’shypnotizing score help make Joker standout film from 2019 that must beviewed more than once to fully grasp. 1. Parasite Dir. Bong Joon-ho Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite isundoubtedly 2019’s must see film. Every aspect of this film from itscast to its cinematography is fantastic. Parasite’s depiction ofthemes of class, wealth, and dignity are apparent but not in your face. Joon-ho’s slow yet persistent race to the end will keep you on the edgeof your seat. Parasite follows the extremely poor Kim family as theylaunch an all-out assault on the blatantly wealthy Park family. WhenKim’s son, Ki-Woo, secures a job as a tutor for the daughter of the Parkfamily, he opens the door for the rest of his family to infiltrate thePark’s home. The Kim family makes quick work of ridding the Parkfamily’s employees and securing their jobs through tactical and cunningplans. Each member of the Kim family has a moment to shine. The filmstarts off presenting itself as a satirical comedy but takes a jarringturn into brutality. The film spirals out of control in front of youreyes and you are forced to view every disturbing second of it. Bong’smastery of the camera and formulation of violence is electrifying inParasite. This film is truly an unforgettable piece of cinema will bedeconstructed, examined, and celebrated for years to come.

    "body": "2019/12/22 - Winter is my favourite season, without a doubt. The snow makeseverything look so picturesque and the break is right on our doorstep. However, for some people, the holidays are dull, with no school tooccupy their days, and friends gone on vacations. But fear not, thereare still so many things to do.  Anything snow-related: Take advantage of the season and get outthere. Build a snowman, go sledding or skating, or have a snowballfight. Winter is also the time to ski, or try something moreoutlandish, like ice fishing or snow sculpting. One of my favouritethings to do is build a snow fort with my friends.   Indoor activities: However fun it is to play in the snow, it’scold. But inside, you can make crafts (a great gift idea), catch upon your reading, draw (the snowy landscape will provide lots ofinspiration), or learn to cook something new. Also, drink hotchocolate, especially after playing in the snow (that’s the besttime to drink it).  Go to a concert: There are lots of concerts in December, manywith holiday themes. So whether you’d like to go see your favouriteartist, or maybe go somewhere new, there will definitely besomething to peak your interest.  Catch up with old friends: I have many friends from elementaryschool who I haven’t seen in a long time. The break is a great timeto reach out and plan a time to get together. And if you don’t knowwhat to do when you see them, perhaps you should try something fromthis list. Happy holidays!Image source:  MerryChristmas!  by xymox islicensed under CC BY-NC-ND2. 0 ich)* "

News, entertainment, music, etc. - withjust the push of a button it’s all there. However, with this newfoundfreedom comes a price that I’m sure you’re already aware of. What we sayonline is usually different, sometimes to an extreme, than what we sayin real life. Most of the warnings that we hear about online safetyinclude never giving away your personal information, or being mindful ofwhat it is you’re saying. But what we don’t hear about as often is howyour personality itself can change.   Let’s say that you’re on an app that connects you to other people (yourfriends, family, even strangers), and you suddenly see something thatinterests you. Immediately you feel the need to comment something, rightthen. The world must know about what you have to say. So, you type aquick comment. Soon, you get a reply and are suddenly having aconversation on a topic that you, in fact, don’t really know much about. So what do you do? Keep having the conversation? It seems as thoughthere’s no other choice. You can’t just log off and leave peoplehanging. So you keep talking, thinking it doesn’t matter. Who cares ifyou’re wrong? This very well might not be you. But the truth is, some people just feelthe need to talk, so, knowing that they’ll never actually meet theperson they’re talking to and knowing they’re not going to have toactually face the consequences of giving said person misinformation,they just keep going. This is really something you need to be watchfulof. Telling other people something that isn’t true and presenting it asfact can mislead lots of people, and can also harm your reputation. Or maybe, instead of talking off the top of your head, you speak inextremes. You might say that you hate something that you see, but reallyjust mildly dislike it. Or perhaps you see something that makes youchuckle a bit, and then say that it was so funny that you were dying oflaughter.   Exaggerating is an easy thing to do on the internet. You want people tolike what you say, to agree with you. So instead of giving an honestreply, you turn your comment into something it’s not, solely for thesake of making more people agree with you. This isn’t a really terriblething, but try to keep it real. While it’s okay to exaggerate a bit, youmight end up having a real conversation when you dial it down a fewnotches too. The last thing people do online is be completely silent. Now this maynot sound as bad, and it isn’t a big problem, especially compared to theother things I’ve been writing about. But you do have social media tobe, well, social. Don’t be so afraid to say something that it keeps youfrom saying anything entirely. A good thing to keep in mind wheninteracting with others on the internet is to say something positive, asopposed to negative. And if someone says something negative to you, tryto be mature. You don’t have to reply, but if you do, make sure that youaren’t being rude or impolite. The best thing to do is just let it go. You didn’t do anything wrong, the other person did, so don’t let thembother you. All in all, just pay attention to what exactly it is that you’re sayingonline. It’s quite easy to misinterpret what anyone could say when it’swritten down, as you don’t have facial expressions or emphasis to guideyou. So be careful, and try to assume the best. You catch more flieswith honey than vinegar. egar. . egar. "

    "body": "2019/12/06 - A lot happens in a year. Each person undergoes easy and hard times,facing both triumph and defeat. This makes up for the time spentthinking, working, and scrambling to get through it all. By December,many people are exhausted, and wish to start over. Awaiting them is anew year. The prospect of something new makes us feel like there’snothing we can’t do, because anything is possible for the future. Thus,we reflect on our past year, and figure out what to do differently fromnow on. With this come our resolutions. People get excited about thechanges they will make to better themselves and their lives. Many can’twait for New Years, and all the apparent bliss that comes with it. However, after New Years, what happens to these resolutions? According to Forbes, studies have shown that less than 25% ofindividuals stay committed to their New Year's Resolutions after just30 days, and only 8% actually accomplish them. These statisticsgive rise to the question: why don’t people keep their resolutions? People tend to fall back into old habits. After the atmosphere ofoptimism surrounding New Years is gone, people will return to the samelifestyles they led before without a thought. Even if they want to alteran aspect of their life, they will live in the same way, and forgetabout their resolutions. Also, we forget that making changes in life takes effort. A lot ofpeople are not willing to try for the small things they want. Stickingto a resolution is easier said than done, and people feel better notattempting something, than trying and possibly failing. Lastly, there is not much motivation to go through with one’sresolutions. New Years is smack in the middle of winter, which is aseason of comfort. The feelings of laziness and sleepiness we feel makeit difficult to want to do anything. This is especially true if yourresolution includes getting out of the house. It is easy to get temptedby a warm sofa or a new Netflix movie instead of stepping out into thesnow. Image source:  Happy NewYear  bynigelhowe is licensedunder CC BY-NC 2. 0 "

Closeyour eyes and read the following. You begin as a piece of cheap fabric that required 2700 litres of water(an average person drinks this in 2. 5 years). The workers are tired,struggling with scars on their hands, to piece you together for a livingwage. However, you are only one of many. About 140 billiongarments *are manufactured each year. The amount of resources spent onyou account for nothing as you have a short lifespan. Your impact? Youproduced 1. 2 billion tonnes of CO2 (per year), yet end up in a landfillproducing more methane. * This horrifying perspective effectively portrays the product life cyclethat a fast fashion piece of garment experiences. This exposes theperceived benefit of $20 jeans that last for a very short amount oftime due to its cheap materials. This short lifespan is largely becauseof brands like Forever21, Zara, and H&amp;M wanting to match the growingdemand for new, trendy clothing, resulting in new clothing designs andstyles being created every few weeks! Instead of two season cycles,there are at least 52 seasons for clothing in the fast fashion industry. Now that you have learned about the harms of the fashion industry, learnabout what you, the consumer, can do to help.  Reduce the amount of clothing you buy from fast fashion stores, or     even better, stop shopping there altogether. Shop from thriftstores or stores that sustainably produce their items. Thedecreasing demand is sure to change their manufacturing processes.     Instead of throwing out your clothing, donate it to stores that     accept them or your friends/family. Before buying your clothes,make sure you know that you will wear it a significant amount oftimes.       Reach out to these fast fashion brands to express your concerns.   Spread awareness to people you know to expose the hidden truths     behind these companies.    This November, empower yourself and others to create less carbonemissions. The fast fashion industry is one of the largest contributors,if not the largest, to climate change. Surprisingly, it is not one thatpeople think of. It’s harm on the planet and terrible working conditionsin factories must be put to an end. "

    "body": "2019/11/10 - If you’re a Marvel fan like me, then you’ve probably heard about therecent drama between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man. If youhaven’t heard about what is happening, here’s a summary. Sony has ownedthe film rights to Spider-Man since 1998. In 2015, they made a deal withDisney, agreeing to lend the character of Spider-Man to Marvel Studios,a company owned by Disney, and to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As wehave seen over the last few years, Tom Holland’s Spider Man has played alarge role in many Marvel movies. Recently, Sony and Disney haverevisited their deal, and gone through negotiations about future stepsfor the Spider-Man character. On August 20th, 2019, Sony announced thatKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, won’t be playing a role in theproduction of the next Spider-Man film. This means that Spider-Man iscurrently not a part of the MCU anymore. This news left fans feelingboth angry and heartbroken, since Marvel’s latest movie, “Spider-Man:Far From Home” had set up Spider-Man to be the new face of thefranchise. Upon hearing about this, I didn’t understand what happenedbetween the two major companies, and wanted to know the reason behindthe decisions being made.   Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man and gets to keep them as long as theymake a new Spider-Man movie every five to six years. They started with“Spider-Man” in 2002, starring Tobey Maguire. After its success, theyproceeded to release “Spider-Man 2”, and then “Spider-Man 3” in 2007. The third movie didn’t do quite as well as hoped, costing $260 millionto make, with profits dipping significantly from the first two movies.   Five years later, Sony decided to reboot the series, and released “TheAmazing Spider-Man” starring Andrew Garfield. This movie made over $700million worldwide. With its success,”The Amazing Spider-Man 2” was made. Unfortunately, it did not live up to Sony’s expectations, with the veryhigh production costs and lessened excitement from fans.   Because of their failed attempts, Sony struck a deal with Disney in  Marvel would be able to use Spider-Man in their cinematicuniverse, while Sony kept distribution rights and creative control. Sonyproducer, Amy Pascal, who played a big role in the creation of theSpider-Man movies since 2002, produced  Spider-Man: Homecoming  and Spider-Man: Far From Home  with Kevin Feige. This deal had beenupheld by both sides, until Sony decided to revisit the idea of makingtheir own Spider-Man films.  Recently, Sony has been doing well with their own ‘Universe of MarvelCharacters’. “Venom” made over $800 million worldwide after beingreleased in 2018, and “Spider-Man: Far From Home” made over $1 billionthis summer. These successes have been “just the rebound Sony needed. ”Spider-Man is Sony’s greatest property, and they are highly motivated tokeep it in their control. . This is why they had such an interest intaking back the character. Another reason why the deal was beingrevisited was because Disney wanted a 50/50 stake in future Spider-Man  movies. Sony wanted to keep the deal as is: where Marvelreceives up to 5% of first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenue. As of right now, no new deal has been made. This indicates that unlesssomething changes, Marvel Studios will not be involved in the making ofnew Spider-Man movies, and no MCU characters will be referenced. Sonyhopes that Director John Watts and star Tom Holland will return for twomore Spider-Man films. Even though this feels like a big loss for fans,we should remember that there are still more movies being made, and eventhough Marvel seems to be out of Spider-Man's life right now, Sony ishopeful that a deal could still be made in the future.   *Note: This article was written before the agreement between Sony andDisney to keep Spiderman in the MCU was reached.

The war was a result of many factors, including politicaltension and military alliances. The assassination of Archduke FranzFerdinand of Austria in 1914 sparked the beginning of a crisis and thewar began that same year in August. It would become a bloody four yearwar with close to 61,000 Canadians killed. Originally the day was called “Armistice Day” to commemorate thearmistice agreement which ended the war on Monday, November 11, 1918, at11 a. m, the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.   Vimy Ridge Considered Canada’s most celebrated Canadian military victory, thebattle of Vimy Ridge was fought from the 9th to 12th of April 1917 onthe Western Front of northern France. Four divisions of the CanadianCorps fought united and captured the ridge from the German army. It wasthe largest territorial advance of any Allied force at that point in thewar. Unfortunately the cost of the victory was overwhelming; more than10,600 Canadians were killed or wounded in the battle. Today a memorialstands at the top of the ridge to honour the 11,285 Canadians killed inFrance throughout the war who have no marked graves. Remembering  The day serves to remember all the lives that were lost in the line ofduty and the countless sacrifices soldiers made to uphold internationalpeace. Historically there is a National Ceremony on the date each year at theNational War Memorial in Ottawa. It is nationally televised and attendedby the Prime Minister, government officials, veterans organizations’representatives, diplomatic representatives, dignitaries, veterans aswell as the general public.

Gone are the days when we could sleep until noon and constantlypress “snooze”. However mornings aren’t the worst! In fact, they canactually be quite nice. They’re quiet and peaceful. The air seemsfresher and catching a sunrise is always a welcome sight. You might evenhave a bit of time to be productive! So without further ado, here aresome tips so you can maximize your mornings! Go to sleep earlier! This one is pretty straightforward. You need adequate sleep to maintainyour health and sanity! What if you have an assignment? Try sleepingearlier and then waking up earlier to finish it before school starts. Help your circadian rhythm by sticking to a regular sleep scheduleincluding on weekends! Setting/choosing an alarm Sure, annoying alarms will get you up but it’ll also put you in a badmood to start your morning. It’ll leave you feeling murderous. Talkabout waking up on the wrong side of your bed. . . Wake up earlier than you normally do I find that when my alarm goes off getting up is crucial. Lingeringunder your covers might be tempting but it also makes you feel moresluggish and loses precious time for your body to get used to beingawake before you’re off to class. Force yourself to get out of bed!It’ll depend on each person but 6am-7am is a good time to wake up. Open your curtains! Natural lighting = very good. Crack open your window for fresh air andto hear the birds chirp! Put on some music! Music can set up the atmosphere and instantly improve your mood in themorning! You could play your favorite jam to get you pumped up or a nicesoundtrack for a calming and happy effect. Water is your best friend Your body hasn’t had any water for hours by now! Down a glass of freshH₂O to rehydrate and splash your face with cold water to get refreshed. You can opt for a quick shower too! Breakfast isn’t negotiable If you’re like me you’re probably guilty of skipping this vital part ofyour mornings. A healthy breakfast improves your memory and mood andhelps you stay concentrated. It’s key for productivity. Recently I’veleaned towards a small bowl of cereal or toast, some fruit and a cup ofgreen tea or coffee! Exercise Some people may find a walk or run in the morning really helpsespecially in the morning when the air feels fresher. Or just brave anice cold shower and get a mini heart attack. A warm shower might justmake your drowsier. Plan your day! The key to a good end is a good start! Jot down a to-do list in yourbullet journal, agenda, phone or just think about it on your commute. Alternatively you can have a morning journal to write your thoughts orkeep track of your dreams. BONUS (Apps to try out!) Sleepyti. me: This is a sleep calculator that really works!

                <p><strong>November: A Time to be Empowered</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Rhea Matharu</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Grade 11 Copy Editor &amp; Production Head</em></p>

<p>I believe, in order to be empowered to take action about this unrevealed
(for now) issue, you will need to be in a different perspective. Close
your eyes and read the following.</p>

<p><em>You begin as a piece of cheap fabric that required 2700 litres of water
(an average person drinks this in 2.5 years). The workers are tired,
struggling with scars on their hands, to piece you together for a living
wage. However, you are only <strong>one</strong></em> of <strong>many</strong>. <em>About</em> <strong>140 billion
garments</strong> *are manufactured each year. The amount of resources spent on
you account for nothing as you have a short lifespan. Your impact? You
produced 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 (per year), yet end up in a landfill
producing more methane. *</p>

<p>This horrifying perspective effectively portrays the product life cycle
that a fast fashion piece of garment experiences. This exposes the
perceived benefit of $20 jeans that last for a very short amount of
time due to its cheap materials. This short lifespan is largely because
of brands like Forever21, Zara, and H&amp;M wanting to match the growing
demand for new, trendy clothing, resulting in new clothing designs and
styles being created every few weeks! Instead of two season cycles,
there are at least 52 seasons for clothing in the fast fashion industry.</p>

<p>Now that you have learned about the harms of the fashion industry, learn
about what you, the consumer, can do to help.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reduce the amount of clothing you buy from fast fashion stores, or
    <blockquote>
      <p>even better, stop shopping there altogether. Shop from thrift
stores or stores that sustainably produce their items. The
decreasing demand is sure to change their manufacturing processes.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Instead of throwing out your clothing, donate it to stores that
    <blockquote>
      <p>accept them or your friends/family. Before buying your clothes,
make sure you know that you will wear it a significant amount of
times.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reach out to these fast fashion brands to express your concerns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Spread awareness to people you know to expose the hidden truths
    <blockquote>
      <p>behind these companies.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This November, empower yourself and others to create less carbon
emissions. The fast fashion industry is one of the largest contributors,
if not the largest, to climate change. Surprisingly, it is not one that
people think of. It’s harm on the planet and terrible working conditions
in factories must be put to an end.</p>
